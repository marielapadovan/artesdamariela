	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Instant availability of a repairable system is a very important measure of its performance. Among the extensive literature in system availability of the steady state, which is the limit of instant availability as time approaches infinity, many methods and approaches have been explored. However, less has been done on instant system availability owing to its theoretical and computational challenges. A new non-parametric estimator of instant availability is proposed. This estimator is both asymptotically consistent and efficient in numerical computation. Multiple numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the new estimator.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtualization is critical to the infrastructure of cloud computing environment and other online services. Hypercall interface is provided by hypervisor to offer privileged requests by the guest domains. Attackers may use this interface to send malicious hypercalls. In the reported work, repetitive hypercall attacks and sending hypercalls within irregular sequences to Xen hypervisor were analyzed, and finally, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed to detect these attacks. The proposed system is placed in the host domain (Dom0). Monitoring hypercalls traffic the system operates based on the identification of irregular behaviors in hypercalls sent from guest domains to hypervisor. Later on, the association rule algorithm is applied on the collected data within a fixed time window, and a set of thresholds for maximum number of all types of the hypercalls is extracted. The results from the implementation of the proposed system show 91&#37; true positive rate.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we explore on a comparative basis the performance suitability of meta-heuristic, sometime denoted as random search algorithms, and greedy-type heuristics for the energy-saving joint dynamic scaling and consolidation of the network-plus-computing resources hosted by networked virtualized data centers when the target is the support of real-time streaming-type applications. For this purpose, the energy and delay performances of Tabu Search (TS), Simulated Annealing (SA) and Evolutionary Strategy (ES) meta-heuristics are tested and compared with the corresponding ones of Best-Fit Decreasing-type heuristics, in order to give insight on the resulting performance-versus-implementation complexity trade-offs. In principle, the considered meta-heuristics and heuristics are general formal approaches that can be applied to large classes of (typically, non-convex and mixed integer) optimization problems. However, specially for the meta-heuristics, a main challenge is to design them to properly address the real-time joint computing-plus-networking resource consolidation and scaling optimization problem. To this purpose, the aim of this paper is: (i) introduce a novel Virtual Machine Allocation (VMA) scheme that aims at choosing a suitable set of possible Virtual Machine placements among the (possibly, non-homogeneous) set of available servers; (ii) propose a new class of random search algorithms (RSAs) denoted as consolidation meta-heuristic, considering the VMA problem in RSAs. In particular, the design of novel variants of meta-heuristics, namely TS-RSC, SA-RSC and ES-RSC, is particularized to the resource scaling and consolidation (RSC) problem; (iii) compare the results of the obtained new RSAs class against some state-of-the-art heuristic approaches. A set of experimental results, both simulated and real-world ones, support the effectiveness of the proposed approaches against the traditional ones.</td>

Nesse contexto, o presente trabalho propõe o MeHarCEn, uma iniciativa para gerenciamento combinado e harmônico do consumo de energia em Data Centers. MeHarCEn não depende de soluções proprietárias e pode ser adaptado a Data Centers com configurações distintas.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Carrier-grade networks (CGNs) can leverage the network programmability of software-defined networking (SDN) to ensure fast recovery and high availability. However, for the successful adoption of SDN, the failure recovery requirement must be addressed. Local detouring is a popular approach for faster recovery rather than path-based end-to-end recovery. For fast local recovery, alternate paths must be preinstalled for each individual flow on the link, which in some cases results in storing thousands of alternate path flow rules. Furthermore, the dependence on the controller for dynamic per-flow detouring may delay the recovery. In this paper, we propose local immediate (LIm) and immediate controller dependent (ICoD) recovery mechanisms to address the limitations of OpenFlow-based link recovery approaches. Our proposed mechanisms considerably reduce the alternate path flow rules by aggregating the disrupted flows using virtual local area network (VLAN) tagging. The proposed algorithms achieve recovery within 3 ms and 20 ms, respectively and satisfy the strict 50 ms recovery requirement of CGNs. LIm and ICoD also reduce the alternate path flow storage requirement by up to 99%. Simulation results reveal that the flow-aggregation also reduces the effort of the controller and minimizes the alternate path installation traffic.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The elastic provisioning of virtual infrastructures enables a dynamic management of cloud resources. Elasticity enables the setup of virtualized resources (computing and communication) in order to meet the hosted application's requirements. Thus, to perform elasticity requests, providers usually rely on reallocation mechanisms and policies. The concerns regarding the environment and the operational costs indicates energy consumption of the data centers as recurring topic in providers policies. Moreover, energy-aware provisioning is beneficial for tenants also. Recent cost models have introduced an implicit incentive to computing and networking resources usage just when requested to avoid high rent costs. In this paper we propose EAVIRA algorithm, which takes into account the proportional sharing of CPU usage of data center servers to calculate individual usage costs to: disable idle equipments, and reallocate virtual infrastructures. EAVIRA acts on online requests for elasticity configuration and performs an offline load balancing, triggered by the IaaS provider. Our experimental analysis indicates a reduction of energy consumption and an increasing on acceptance ratio of allocation requests.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Modern cloud computing systems are prone to disasters. And the true cost due to service outages is reportedly huge. Some of previous works presented the use of hierarchical models: fault tree (FT), reliability block diagram (RBD) along with state-space models: continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) or stochastic petri nets (SPN) to assess the reliability/availability of cloud systems, but with much simplification. In this paper, we attempt to propose a combinatorial monolithic model using reliability graph (RG) for a real-world cloud system called general purpose integrated cloud system (GENESIS). The system is designed in active-active high availability configuration with two geographically distributed cloud sites for the sake of disaster tolerance (DT). We then present the model-based comprehensive analysis of system reliability/availability and their sensitivity. The results pinpoint different findings in which the architecture of active-active and geographically dispersed sites with appropriate interconnections of the cloud apparently enhance the system reliability/availability and assure disaster tolerance for the cloud.</td>

Afterwards, a column generation (CG) algorithm and a cutting rule (CR) scheme are proposed respectively.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the big data era, the distributed file system is getting more and more significant due to the characteristics of its scale-out capability, high availability, and high performance. Different distributed file systems may have different design goals. For example, some of them are designed to have good performance for small file operations, such as GlusterFS, while some of them are designed for large file operations, such as Hadoop distributed file system. With the divergence of big data applications, a distributed file system may provide good performance for some applications but fails for some other applications, that is, there has no universal distributed file system that can produce good performance for all applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid file system framework, HybridFS, which can deliver satisfactory performance for all applications. HybridFS is composed of multiple distributed file systems with the integration of advantages of these distributed file systems. In HybridFS, on top of multiple distributed file systems, we have designed a metadata management server to perform three functions: file placement, partial metadata store, and dynamic file migration. The file placement is performed based on a decision tree. The partial metadata store is performed for files whose size is less than a few hundred Bytes to increase throughput. The dynamic file migration is performed to balance the storage usage of distributed file systems without throttling performance. We have implemented HybridFS in java on eight nodes and choose Ceph, HDFS, and GlusterFS as designated distributed file systems. The experimental results show that, in the best case, HybridFS can have up to 30&#37; performance improvement of read/write operations over a single distributed file system. In addition, if the difference of storage usage among multiple distributed file systems is less than 40 the performance of HybridFS is guaranteed, that is, no performance degradation.</td>

Fault-tolerance strategies, such as checkpoint, are commonly employed. Because of the failure of the edge switches, the checkpoint image may become inaccessible. Therefore, current checkpoint-based fault tolerance method cannot achieve the best effect. In this paper, we propose an optimal checkpoint method with edge switch failure-aware. The edge switch failure-aware checkpoint method includes two algorithms. The first algorithm employs the data center topology and communication characteristic for checkpoint image storage server selection. The second algorithm employs the checkpoint image storage characteristic as well as the data center topology to select the recovery server. Simulation experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Despite employing the architectures designed for high service reliability and availability, cloud computing systems do experience service outages and performance slowdown. In addition to these, large-scale cloud systems experience failures in their hardware and software components which often result in node and application (e.g., jobs and tasks) failures. Therefore, to build a reliable cloud system, it is important to understand and characterize the observed failures. The goal of this work is to identify the key features that correlate to application failures in cloud and present a failure prediction model that can correctly predict the outcome of a task or job before it actually finishes, fails or gets killed. To accomplish this, we perform a failure characterization study of the Google cluster workload trace. Our analysis reveals that, there is a significant consumption of resources due to failed and killed jobs. We further explore the potential for failure prediction in cloud applications so that we can reduce the wastage of resources by better managing the jobs and tasks that ultimately fail or get killed. For this, we propose a prediction method based on a special type of Recurrent NeuralNetwork (RNN) named Long Short-Term Memory Network(LSTM) to identify application failures in cloud. It takes resource usage measurements or performance data for each job and task, and the goal is to predict the termination status (e.g., failed and finished etc.) of them. Our algorithm can predict task failures with 87%accuracy and achieves a true positive rate of 85&#37; and false positive rate of 11%.</td>

However, dealing with several instances of the same application that access its state in a common area is not a simple task. This paper presents a novel PaaS framework, named NoPaaS, that supports the deployment of multi-tier and stateful applications assuring their availability according to the Service Availability Forum (SAF) redundancy model. The primary goal of this work is to present NoPaaS framework and prototype, and highlight challenges and open issues when providing multi-tier and stateful applications in high availability clouds.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing continues to mature and more applications continue to be deployed in public clouds. Client applications deployed in the cloud should automatically scale up and down to match changing workload demands, though they must be careful to ensure that sufficient resources are provisioned to achieve performance objectives. The cloud provider, on the other hand, attempts to reduce costs by reducing power consumption by consolidating load onto fewer, highly utilized machines. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that integrates both application autoscaling and dynamic virtual machine (VM) allocation into a single algorithm in order to achieve the goals of both cloud provider and client. Further, we consider multi-VM applications, such as multi-tiered web-based applications, and extend the integrated algorithm to take the network topology into account when placing or migrating applications. The goal is to reduce VM-to-VM communication latency; our focus is on trying to contain applications within the same racks. We evaluate our work through simulation, showing that the integrated algorithm can achieve better application performance with a significant reduction in virtual machine live migrations, and the topology-aware extension successfully places applications within a single rack.</td>

In particular, two well-known open source projects, OpenDaylight (ODL) and Open Network Operating System (ONOS), are analyzed in terms of high availability (i.e., network state database replication/synchronization and controller failover mechanisms) and scalability (i.e., network state database partition/ distribution and controller assignment mechanisms) issues. We also present experimental results on the flow rule installation/read throughput and the failover time upon a controller failure in ONOS and ODL, and identify open research challenges.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing infrastructures are designed to be accessible anywhere and anytime. This requires various fault tolerance mechanisms for coping with software and hardware failures. Hierarchical modeling approaches are often used to evaluate the availability of such systems, leveraging the representation of complex failure and repair events in distinct parts of the system. This paper presents an availability evaluation for redundant private clouds, represented by RBDs and Markov chains, hierarchically assembled. These private clouds follow the basic architecture of Eucalyptus-based environments, but employing warm-standby redundant hosts for some of its main components. Closed-form equations for the steady-state availability are presented, allowing direct analytical solution for large systems. The availability equations are symbolically differentiated, allowing parametric sensitivity analysis. The results from sensitivity analysis enables system planning for improving the steady- state availability. The sensitivity indices show that failure of the Eucalyptus Cloud Manager subsystem and the respective repair activities deserve priority for maximizing the system availability.</td>

Virtualization technology, which can be regarded as the first step in the cloud by offering benefits like the virtual machine and live migration, is trying to overcome this problem. Virtual machines host workload, and because of the variability of workload, virtual machines consolidation is an effective technique to minimize the total number of active servers and unnecessary migrations and consequently improves energy consumption. Effective virtual machine placement and migration techniques act as a key issue to optimize the consolidation process. In this paper, we present a novel virtual machine consolidation technique to achieve energy–QoS–temperature balance in the cloud data center. We simulated our proposed technique in CloudSim simulation. Results of evaluation certify that physical machine temperature, SLA, and migration technique together control the energy consumption and QoS in a cloud data center.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cost savings have become a significant challenge in the management of data centers. In this paper, we show that, besides energy consumption, service level agreement(SLA) violations also severely degrade the cost-efficiency of data centers. We present online VM placement algorithms for increasing cloud provider's revenue. First, First-Fit and Harmonic algorithm are devised for VM placement without considering migrations. Both algorithms get the same performance in the worst-case analysis, and equal to the lower bound of the competitive ratio. However, Harmonic algorithm could create more revenue than First-Fit by more than 10 percent when job arriving rate is greater than 1.0. Second, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing revenue from VM migration, and prove it as NP-Hard by a reduction from 3-Partition problem. Therefore, we propose two heuristics: Least-Reliable-First (LRF) and Decreased-Density-Greedy (DDG). Experiments demonstrate that DDG yields more revenue than LRF when migration cost is low, yet leads to losses when SLA penalty is low or job arriving rate is high, due to the large number of migrations. Finally, we compare the four algorithms above with algorithms adopted in Openstack using a real trace, and find that the results are consistent with the ones using synthetic data.</td>

We argue that formal standards and regulation have different effects, depending on the extent of market uncertainty derived from theoretical considerations about information asymmetry and regulatory capture. Our empirical analysis is based on the German Community Innovation Survey (CIS). The results show that formal standards lead to lower innovation efficiency in markets with low uncertainty, while regulations have the opposite effect. In cases of high market uncertainty, we observe that regulation leads to lower innovation efficiency, while formal standards have the reverse effect. Our results have important implications for the future application of both instruments, showing that their benefits heavily depend on the market environment.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: New trends and emerging requirements have driven the development of extensions to the path computation element (PCE) architecture beyond the computation of a set of constrained routes and associated resources between endpoints, given a network topology. Such extensions involve the use of a PCE for the control of network services, in which deploying a PCE as a centralized network controller facilitates the adoption of software-defined networking (SDN) principles while allowing a progressive migration of already existing deployments. A key requirement for the adoption of centralized control solutions is the ability to deploy a resilient, secure, dynamically configurable, adaptive, and highly available (virtualized) infrastructure supporting end-to-end services, including critical and vertical ones. Part of this infrastructure is the control plane functional elements (e.g., controllers), and the use of network function virtualization (NFV) is a enabler for the high availability of such elements while additionally reducing OPEX and CAPEX. NFV provides a feature-complete framework for the replication of software components that is a straightforward and commonly adopted approach to address the aforementioned requirement, but it implies the need for timely synchronization of databases between replicas. In this paper we present, implement, and validate an architecture for PCE and SDN control high availability, combining the virtualization of the control function by means of dynamic replication and the timely synchronization of their internal state using the PCEP and BGP-LS protocols. We experimentally validate the approach with a testbed, including a GMPLS/PCE control plane, and a replica management system implemented following the ETSI NFV framework, using the OpenStack cloud management software.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing provides support for hosting client's application. Cloud is a distributed platform that provides hardware, software and network resources to both execute consumer's application and also to store and mange user's data. Cloud is also used to execute scientific workflow applications that are in general complex in nature when compared to other applications. Since cloud is a distributed platform, it is more prone to errors and failures. In such an environment, avoiding a failure is difficult and identifying the source of failure is also complex. Because of this, fault tolerance mechanisms are implemented on the cloud platform. This ensures that even if there are failures in the environment, critical data of the client is not lost and user's application running on cloud is not affected in any manner. Fault tolerance mechanisms also help in improving the cloud's performance by proving the services to the users as required on demand. In this paper a survey of existing fault tolerance mechanisms for the cloud platform are discussed. This paper also discusses the failures, fault tolerant clustering methods and fault tolerant models that are specific for scientific workflow applications.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing data centers are growing rapidly in both number and capacity to meet the increasing demands for highly-responsive computing and massive storage. Such data centers consume enormous amounts of electrical energy resulting in high operating costs and carbon dioxide emissions. The reason for this extremely high energy consumption is not just the quantity of computing resources and the power inefficiency of hardware, but rather lies in the inefficient usage of these resources. VM consolidation involves live migration of VMs hence the capability of transferring a VM between physical servers with a close to zero down time. It is an effective way to improve the utilization of resources and increase energy efficiency in cloud data centers. VM consolidation consists of host overload/underload detection, VM selection and VM placement. Most of the current VM consolidation approaches apply either heuristic-based techniques, such as static utilization thresholds, decision-making based on statistical analysis of historical data; or simply periodic adaptation of the VM allocation. Most of those algorithms rely on CPU utilization only for host overload detection. In this paper we propose using hybrid factors to enhance VM consolidation. Specifically we developed a multiple regression algorithm that uses CPU utilization, memory utilization and bandwidth utilization for host overload detection. The proposed algorithm, Multiple Regression Host Overload Detection (MRHOD), significantly reduces energy consumption while ensuring a high level of adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLA) since it gives a real indication of host utilization based on three parameters (CPU, Memory, Bandwidth) utilizations instead of one parameter only (CPU utilization). Through simulations we show that our approach reduces power consumption by 6 times compared to single factor algorithms using random workload. Also using PlanetLab workload traces we show that MRHOD improves the ESV metric by about 24&#37; better than other single factor regression algorithms (LR and LRR). Also we developed Hybrid Local Regression Host Overload Detection algorithm (HLRHOD) that is based on local regression using hybrid factors. It outperforms the single factor algorithms.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: With the rise of cloud computing and virtualization of resources, cloud management systems are becoming a key differentiator for the quality of service offered by the cloud providers. OpenStack is considered the de-facto open-source cloud management system at the infrastructure as a service layer. Despite the efforts of hardening the high availability of OpenStack, its fault tolerance during the provisioning of resources is yet to be proven. In this paper we present a testing framework for the fault tolerance of OpenStack, namely TestStack. We expose the limitations of OpenStack by injecting runtime failures into a highly available OpenStack environment. Our testing results reveal inconsistencies in the behavior of OpenStack in the presence of failures that we address by proposing our solution, namely FTStack, to harden its fault tolerance.</td>

The availability of virtualized systems and services needs to be on par with that for non-virtualized systems and services. However, high availability (HA) designs for virtualized systems and services are much more complicated than those for their non-virtualized counterparts due to the existence of independent multiple layers where each layer may have its own failure recovery mechanism. This paper defines a novel approach to the design of highly available virtualized systems and services. The recovery from failures is self-coordinated. There are no race conditions among layers.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract: The use of cloud computing has increased in recent days with tremendous benefits to users and also provoked to rise in total ownership cost due to swift increase in energy consumption of data centers. Out of various approaches, best of virtual machine placement policies can be exploited to reduce the energy consumption during migration in data centers. The virtual machine live migration during placement has enough potential to reduce energy consumption with certain level of utilization. One of the mechanisms to achieve energy efficiency is to manage the migration time parameter of live migration with appropriate network bandwidth in communication aware connected data centers. In spite of this, virtual machine size and network bandwidth have a great impact on energy consumption of sub systems during virtual machine live migration. To follow this study, in this paper, analysis has been made to see the impact of migration time on energy consumption of sub systems during guest virtual machine live migration. For experimentation, Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor and Virt Manager was used to perform live migration on Ubuntu 14.04 Linux machines in various conditions. Afterwards, the noted observations are validated with Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient statistical approach to study the strength of relationship of defined parameters.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing is an on-demand access model for computing resources most notably embodied by the OpenStack project. As of release Liberty, OpenStack supports provisioning Bare-metal, Virtual machine (VM) and container based hosts. These different hosts incur different overheads. Consequently, the main goal of this paper is to empirically quantify that overhead through a series of experiments. The following drivers are leveraged in this process: Ironic for Bare-metal or Metal as a Service (MaaS), nova-compute for VM-based hosts, and nova-docker for Docker based containers. We make use of a private-cloud in order to compare the different options. This cloud is then used to compare the different hosts in terms of performance (CPU, networking, disk I/O and RAM) by using various open-source benchmarking tools. We also measure boot-up times. The output of these benchmarks is collected and results are compared. In this paper we discuss our learnings as well as the different configurations and fine-tuning that we implemented. As a result, we provide a set of recommendations based on the advantages and disadvantages of each host in present and future cloud deployments. © 2017 IEEE.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing has become an essential part of the global digital economy due to its extensibility, flexibility and reduced costs of operations. Nowadays, data centers (DCs) contain thousands of different machines running a huge number of diverse applications over an extended period. Resource management in Cloud is an open issue since an efficient resource allocation can reduce the infrastructure running cost. In this paper, we propose a snapshot-based solution for server consolidation problem from Cloud infrastructure provider (CIP) perspective. Our proposed mathematical formulation aims at reducing power cost by employing efficient server consolidation, and also considering the issues such as (i) mapping incoming and failing virtual machines (VMs), (ii) reducing a total number of VM migrations and (iii) consolidating running server workloads. We also compare the performance of our proposed model to the well-known Best Fit heuristics and its extension to include server consolidation via VM migration denoted as Best Fit with Consolidation (BFC). Our proposed mathematical formulation allows us to measure the solution quality in absolute terms, and it can also be applicable in practice. In our simulations, we show that relevant improvements (from 6&#37; to 15 over the widely adopted Best Fit algorithm achieved in a reasonable computing time.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing has become one of the most used platforms to deploy High Availability (HA) solutions for its flexibility, on-demand provisioning, and elasticity. However, although many providers offer specific tools for HA support, like floating IPs and load balancing, the analysis of downtime at public cloud providers in previous years shows that a combination of several availability zones or cloud providers is required to achieve “five nines” availability. Besides reducing the chances of failure, the use of multiple availability zones and geographically distributed clouds may additionally bring performance and cost benefits. However, the orchestration, in an efficient and adaptive way, of HA multi-tier services in multi-zone and multi-cloud environments brings several challenges. This paper presents a novel orchestration method to automate the deployment and management of high availability multi-tier services on multiple availability zones, by introducing new affinity mechanisms, such as VM to location and role to role affinity/anti-affinity rules. Furthermore, we also extend this solution to multi-cloud scenarios, based on the replication or distribution of the service components among various clouds, along with their corresponding affinity rules.</td>

In this context, metrics are fundamental for comparison and management purposes, along with the methods and tools which support such metrics’ capture and analysis. However, prior works on green metrics and tools have presented only a partial view, mainly as a result of the recent advances in green networking technologies. In this survey, we present an extensive study of metrics, methods, and tools to support sustainable operations in distributed cloud networks, with the aim of providing an end-to-end and up-to-date scenario to support current and coming research, as well as to analyze existing gaps.</td>

There are a number of algorithms for allocating the workload among different machines. However, existing works do not consider more than one energy efficient host, thus they are not efficient for large scale cloud datacenters. In this paper, we propose a VM allocation algorithm to achieve higher energy efficiency in large scale cloud datacenters. Simulation result shows that, compared with BRS, RR and MPD algorithms, our algorithms can achieve 23  23 &#37; and 9 &#37; more power efficiency in large scale cloud environment.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Energy efficiency has grown into a latest exploration area of virtualized cloud computing paradigm. The increase in the number and the size of the cloud data centers has propagated the need for energy efficiency. An extensively practiced technology in cloud computing is live virtual machine migration and is thus focused in this work to save energy. This paper proposes an energy-aware virtual machine migration technique for cloud computing, which is based on the Firefly algorithm. The proposed technique migrates the maximally loaded virtual machine to the least loaded active node while maintaining the performance and energy efficiency of the data centers. The efficacy of the proposed technique is exhibited by comparing it with other techniques using the CloudSim simulator. An enhancement in the average energy consumption of about 44.39 &#37; has been attained by reducing an average of 72.34 &#37; of migrations and saving 34.36 &#37; of hosts, thereby, making the data center more energy-aware.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The multi-tier architecture style has become an industry standard in modern data centers with each tier providing certain functionality. To avoid congestion and to adhere the SLA under fluctuating workload and unpredictable failures of Mission Critical Multi-tier applications hosted in the cloud, we need a Dynamic admission control policy, such that the requests must be processed from the first tier to the last without any delay. This paper presents the least strict admission control policy, which will induce the maximal throughput, for a two-tier system with parallel servers. We propose an optimization model to minimize the total number of virtual machines for computing resources in each tier by dynamically varying the mean service rate of the VMs. Some performance indicators and computational results showing the effect of model parameters are presented. This model is also applicable to priority as well as real-time based applications in Cloud based environment.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Availability assessment of a data center with disaster tolerance (DT) is demanding for cloud computing based businesses. Previous work attempted to model and analyze the computing systems without a good consideration on disaster occurrence, unexpected failure of network connection and proper dependencies between subsystems in a data center. This paper presents a comprehensive availability model of a data center for DT using stochastic reward nets (SRN). The model incorporates (i) a typical two-level high availability (HA) configuration (i.e., active/active between sites and active/passive within a site), (ii) various fault and disaster tolerant techniques; (iii) dependencies between subsystems (e.g. between a host and virtual machines (VMs), between a network area storage (NAS) and VMs) and dependency between disastrous events and physical subsystems; and (iv) unexpected failures during data transmission between data centers. The constructed SRN model is analyzed on the basis of steady state analysis, downtime cost analysis, and sensitivity analysis with regard to major impacting parameters. The analysis results show the availability improvement of the disaster tolerant data center (DTDC) and featured system responses corresponding to the selected variables. The modeling and analysis of the DTDC in this paper provide a selection basis of designing for disasters in consideration of the trade-off between system availability and downtime cost with infrastructure construction cost.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents the Topology-aware Virtual Machine Placement algorithm, which aims at placing groups of virtual machines in data centers. It was designed to occupy small areas of the data center network in order to consolidate the network flows produced by the virtual machines. Extensive simulation is used to show that the proposed algorithm prevents the formation of network bottlenecks, therefore accepting more requests of allocation of virtual machines. Moreover, these advantages are obtained without compromising energy efficiency. The energy consumption of servers and switches are taken into account, and these are switched off whenever idle.</td>

The Design Of A Mechanism That Efficiently Prices Perishable Cloud Resources In Line With A Provider&rsquo;s Profit Maximization Goal Remains An Open Research Challenge, However. In This Article, We Propose The Online Extended Consensus Revenue Estimate Mechanism In The Setting Of A Recurrent, Multiunit And Single Price Auction For Iaas Cloud Resources. The Mechanism Is Envy-free, Has A High Probability Of Being Truthful, And Generates A Near Optimal Profit For The Provider. We Combine The Proposed Auction Design With A Scheme For Dynamically Calculating Reserve Prices Based On Data Center Power Usage Effectiveness (pue) And Electricity Costs. Our Simulation-based Evaluation Of The Mechanism Demonstrates Its Effectiveness Under A Broad Variety Of Market Conditions. In Particular, We Show How It Improves On The Classical Uniform Price Auction, And We Investigate The Value Of Prior Knowledge On The Execution Time Of Virtual Machines For Maximizing Profit. We Also Developed A System Prototype And Conducted A Small-scale Experimental Study With A Group Of 10 Users That Confirms The Truthfulness Property Of The Mechanism In A Real Test Environment.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: A recent fast growing development and demand in high performance computing has brought IT technocrats on forefeet to devise energy aware mechanisms so that CO2 emission can be reduced to a great extent. The resources in cloud data centers are always over provisioned in order to meet the peak workload. These resources consume a huge amount of energy, if used in their full capacity. By dynamically adopting the green computing policies as per current workload, the energy consumption of cloud data center can be reduced. In the present study, VM migration process has been discussed and the simulation driven results for evaluation of the proposed heuristic on the basis of static upper and lower limits allowed for CPU utilization have been presented. The comparative analysis of resource utilization and power consumption of a data center, with and without migration policy, reveals that a significant amount of power consumption can be reduced by VM migration and utilization of resources can be optimized.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents the GreenHop solution, focused on energy and environmental monitoring in small and medium size Data Centers (DCs). The solution enables the DC administrator to monitor the DC PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) and maintain the environmental parameters in compliance with standards and good practice guidances. The solution is applied in a case study, showing the consumption of the cooling equipment when setting the DC operating temperature on 18°C, 23°C, 25°C, and free cooling. Thus, we identified an improvement on PUE and reduction of power consumption as a result of the adoption GreenHop monitoring solution.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Several organizations carry out the execution of their systems and data processing services in local processing centers, i.e., data centers (DC). However, small to medium - sized organizations usually do not have technical and financial conditions to monitor the climatic conditions of their DC. Thus, this may imply from excessive energy costs, drastic reduction of the life spam of the equipment and the incorrect processing of data and systems. In this paper we present the open source based solution GreenHop that aims to perform environmental monitoring of the DC server room. This paper presents four tests with different temperature settings, which is also included the application of free cooling method. We present a comparison of the energy impact of all settings. Thus, we aim to provide ambiental monitoring of the DC server room while we keep the system customizable to implement and replicate.</td>

In Particular, The Key Performance Indexes (kpis) Monitoring Is A Crucial Activity For Several Reasons: It Is One Of The Early Activities, It Affects The Measurement Quality Of Kpis And It Deeply Impacts The Enms Requirements And, Consequently, The Investment Valuations. The Proposed Strategy Supports The Energy Managers In The Design Of The Energy Monitoring System Suggesting The Points Of The Electrical Network To Be Equipped With Sensors And Monitored. Moreover, The Paper Describes The Results Carried Out In A Real-world Application: The Energy Sensor Network Of A 1.2mw Flour Mill Plant Sited In Italy Has Been Designed And Implemented With The Proposed Innovative Solution.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Scalable, High Performance, And Fault-tolerant Distributed Applications Are Realized With Virtual Machines In Server Cluster Systems. Application Processes Are Performed On Virtual Machines In Each Server. Processing Load Of Virtual Machines To Perform Application Processes Has To Be Balanced In A Server Cluster System To Satisfy The Application Requirements Like Response Time. On The Other Hand, A Server Cluster System Consumes A Large Amount Of Electric Energy Since Multiple Servers Consume Electric Energy To Perform Application Processes. It Is Critical To Discuss How To Reduce The Total Electric Energy Consumption Of A Server Cluster To Perform Application Processes On Virtual Machines. In Our Previous Studies, The Transmission Model And Power Consumption Model Of A Server To Perform Communication Processes On Multiple Virtual Machines Are Proposed. In This Paper, We Newly Propose The Transmission Energy Consumption Laxity Based (teclb) Algorithm To Allocate Communication Processes To Virtual Machines In A Server Cluster Based On The Proposed Transmission Model And Power Consumption Model Of A Server So That The Total Energy Consumption Of A Server Cluster Can Be Reduced. We Evaluate The Teclb Algorithm In Terms Of The Total Energy Consumption Of A Server Cluster And Transmission Time Of Each Process Compared With The Basic Round-robin (rr) Algorithm. The Evaluation Results Show The Average Total Energy Consumption Of A Server Cluster Is Maximumly Reduced To 9% Of The Rr Algorithm.</td>

It Is Difficult To Determine The Suitable Amount Of Resources Required To Run Cloud Services In Response To The Varying Workloads, And This May Lead To Undesirable States Of Over-provisioning And Under-provisioning. In This Paper, We Address Improvements To Resource Provisioning For Cloud Services By Proposing An Autonomic Resource Provisioning Approach That Is Based On The Concept Of The Control Monitor-analyze-plan-execute (mape) Loop, And We Design A Resource Provisioning Framework For Cloud Environments. The Experimental Results Show That The Proposed Approach Reduces The Total Cost By Up To 35 The Number Of Service Level Agreement (sla) Violations By Up To 40 And Increases The Resource Utilization By Up To 25 % Compared With The Other Approaches.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In A Cloud Computing Paradigm, Energy Efficient Allocation Of Different Virtualized Ict Resources (servers, Storage Disks, And Networks, And The Like) Is A Complex Problem Due To The Presence Of Heterogeneous Application (e.g., Content Delivery Networks, Mapreduce, Web Applications, And The Like) Workloads Having Contentious Allocation Requirements In Terms Of Ict Resource Capacities (e.g., Network Bandwidth, Processing Speed, Response Time, Etc.). Several Recent Papers Have Tried To Address The Issue Of Improving Energy Efficiency In Allocating Cloud Resources To Applications With Varying Degree Of Success. However, To The Best Of Our Knowledge There Is No Published Literature On This Subject That Clearly Articulates The Research Problem And Provides Research Taxonomy For Succinct Classification Of Existing Techniques. Hence, The Main Aim Of This Paper Is To Identify Open Challenges Associated With Energy Efficient Resource Allocation. In This Regard, The Study, First, Outlines The Problem And Existing Hardware And Software-based Techniques Available For This Purpose. Furthermore, Available Techniques Already Presented In The Literature Are Summarized Based On The Energy-efficient Research Dimension Taxonomy. The Advantages And Disadvantages Of The Existing Techniques Are Comprehensively Analyzed Against The Proposed Research Dimension Taxonomy Namely: Resource Adaption Policy, Objective Function, Allocation Method, Allocation Operation, And Interoperability.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtualization supplies a straightforward approach to high availability through iterative replications of virtual machine (VM) checkpoints that encapsulate the protected services. Unfortunately, traditional VM replication solutions suffer from deficiencies in either response latency or state recovery consistency, which constrains the adoption of VM replication in production. In this paper, we extend the function of the secondary host to be the primary recipient of network requests so that the state of the primary VM (PVM) is retained by the secondary host in the form of network packets. In doing this, we redesign the typical consistency model and network architecture for virtual machine replication. Specifically, the secondary host is set for network redirection and packets recording. Should the primary host fail, the recorded packets are used to recreate the state on the secondary host. Experiments in this research demonstrate simultaneously strong recovery consistency and low response latency in our real-time fault tolerance system. We name the system reverse replication of virtual machines (rRVM).</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing is an essential part of today's computing world. Continuously increasing amount of computation with varying resource requirements is placed in large data centers. The variation among computing tasks, both in their resource requirements and time of processing, makes it possible to optimize the usage of physical hardware by applying cloud technologies. In this work, we develop a prototype system for load-based management of virtual machines in an OpenStack computing cluster. Our prototype is based on an idea of `packing' idle virtual machines into special park servers optimized for this purpose. We evaluate the method by running real high-energy physics analysis software in an OpenStack test cluster and by simulating the same principle using the Cloudsim simulator software. The results show a clear improvement, 9–48 &#37; , in the total energy efficiency when using our method together with resource overbooking and heterogeneous hardware.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: With the development of virtualization technology, it is a prevailing trend that users deploy highly reliable, scalable, high efficiency application services via virtual machines. OpenStack, the most fiery open-source virtual machines management platform, focuses on IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service), and now expands to PaaS(Platform as a Service) and SaaS(Software as a Service). As a Mature IaaS cloud computing product, it's no doubt that it should take data replication and storage mechanism into consideration as a precondition, in order to ensure the integrity and continuity of service provided for users. At the mention of storage, Ceph, a unified, high reliability, high performance and scalable distributed file system, comes to OpenStack's mind, providing block storage, object storage and file storage. To solve the problem that OpenStack only supported Single-level image management which wastes a fairly large number of storage space, we have studied Ceph storage cluster with OpenStack integration architecture and achieved the multi-level image software assembly technology. From the aspect of storage space, the technology eliminate duplication of shared operating system image data and shared application software image data. From the aspect of time, users don't have to install the required application softwares manually, providing the time-saving as well. Once you launched your virtual machine instances, the required softwares have been installed already.</td>

Business continuity is a remarkable property and it is a chief concern for many companies, since service disruption may cause huge revenue and market share losses. In recent years, cloud computing has turned into a remarkable alternative due to its resource on-demand and pay-as-you-go models. More specifically, additional resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), are only allocated when disaster takes place, and the automated virtual platform also performs a transparent recovery to minimize the service time to restore.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing provides on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, which enables organizations to outsource their IT infrastructure. Cloud providers are building data centers to handle the continuous increase in cloud users’ demands. Consequently, these cloud data centers consume, and have the potential to waste, substantial amounts of energy. This energy consumption increases the operational cost and the CO2 emissions. The goal of this paper is to develop an optimized energy and SLA-aware virtual machine (VM) placement strategy that dynamically assigns VMs to Physical Machines (PMs) in cloud data centers. This placement strategy co-optimizes energy consumption and service level agreement (SLA) violations. The proposed solution adopts utility functions to formulate the VM placement problem. A genetic algorithm searches the possible VMs-to-PMs assignments with a view to finding an assignment that maximizes utility. Simulation results using CloudSim show that the proposed utility-based approach reduced the average energy consumption by approximately 6 &#37; and the overall SLA violations by more than 38  using fewer VM migrations and PM shutdowns, compared to a well-known heuristics-based approach.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Data Centers Are An Indispensable Part Of Today's It Infrastructure. To Keep Pace With Modern Computing Needs, Data Centers Continue To Grow In Scale And Consume Increasing Amounts Of Power. While Prior Work On Data Centers Has Led To Significant Improvements In Their Energy-efficiency, Detailed Measurements From These Facilities' Operations Are Not Widely Available, As Data Center Design Is Often Considered Part Of A Company's Competitive Advantage. However, Such Detailed Measurements Are Critical To The Research Community In Motivating And Evaluating New Energy-efficiency Optimizations. In This Paper, We Present A Detailed Analysis Of A State-of-the-art 15mw Green Multi-tenant Data Center That Incorporates Many Of The Technological Advances Used In Commercial Data Centers. We Analyze The Data Center's Computing Load And Its Impact On Power, Water, And Carbon Usage Using Standard Effectiveness Metrics, Including Pue, Wue, And Cue. Our Results Reveal The Benefits Of Optimizations, Such As Free Cooling, And Provide Insights Into How The Various Effectiveness Metrics Change With The Seasons And Increasing Capacity Usage. More Broadly, Our Pue, Wue, And Cue Analysis Validate The Green Design Of This Leed Platinum Data Center.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: There are some data centers that are located far from the main data center for ensuring continuity of company's Information Technology operations in case the main data center encounters a serious downtime especially for companies engaged to work in distributed manner to increase quality-of -service to their customers. Environmental downtime is a significant cost to organizations and makes them unable to do business because what happens in the data center affects everyone. In addition, the amount of electrical energy consumed by data center increases with the amount of computing power installed. One strategy of reducing energy consumption in data centers is to adjust the temperature and humidity data. Installation of physical Information Technology and facilities related to environment on monitoring temperature, humidity, power, flood, smoke, air flow, room entry is the most proactive way to reduce the unnecessary costs of expensive hardware replacement or unplanned downtime and decrease energy consumed by servers. In this paper, we present remote system for monitoring auxiliary data centers implemented using open-source hardware platforms, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and the Gobetwino. The objective of collecting temperature and humidity data allows monitoring server's health and gets alerts if things start to go wrong. When the temperature hits 50oC., the supervisor at remote headquarters would get a SMS, then take appropriate actions that make sense to reduce electrical costs and preserve functionality of servers in auxiliary data centers. The data center environmental monitoring represents a step forward towards addressing awareness monitoring of energy efficiency and data centers located far with ability to receive a notification by email.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The Energy Demand For Operating Information And Communication Technology (ict) Systems Has Been Growing, Implying In High Operational Costs And Consequent Increase Of Carbon Emissions. Both In Datacenters And Telecom Infrastructures, The Networks Represent A Significant Amount Of Energy Spending. Given That, There Is An Increased Demand For Energy Efficiency Solutions, And Several Capabilities To Save Energy Have Been Proposed. However, It Is Very Difficult To Orchestrate Such Energy Efficiency Capabilities, That Is, Coordinate Or Combine Them In The Same Network, Ensuring A Conflict-free Operation And Choosing The Best One For A Given Scenario, Ensuring That A Capability Not Suited To The Current Bandwidth Utilization Will Not Be Applied And Lead To Congestion Or Packet Loss. There Is Neither A Way To Do This Taking Business Directives Into Account. In This Regard, A Method Able To Orchestrate Different Energy Efficiency Capabilities Is Proposed Considering The Possible Combinations And Conflicts Among Them, As Well As The Best Option For A Given Workload And Network Characteristics. The Business Policies Are Refined Down To The Network Level In Order To Bring High-level Directives Into The Operation, And A Utility Function Is Used To Combine Energy Efficiency And Performance Requirements. A Decision Tree Able To Determine What To Do In Each Scenario Is Deployed In A Software Defined Network Environment. The Proposed Method Was Validated With Different Experiments, Testing The Utility Function, Checking The Extra Savings When Combining Several Capabilities, The Decision Tree Interpolation And Dynamicity Aspects. The Orchestration Proved Valid To Solve The Problem Of Finding The Best Combination For A Given Scenario, Achieving Additional Savings Due To The Combination, Besides Ensuring A Conflict-free Operation. Highlightsa Method Able To Orchestrate Different Energy Efficiency Capabilities Is Proposed.it Considers The Possible Combinations And Conflicts Among The Capabilities.it Refines Business Policies To Bring High-level Directives Into The Operation.the Method Solves The Problem Of Finding The Best Combination For A Given Scenario.and Achieved Additional Savings, Besides Ensuring A Conflict-free Operation.</td>

In 2014, Data Centers In The U.s. Consumed An Estimated 70 Billion Kwh, Representing About 1.8% Of Total U.s. Electricity Consumption. This Report Shows That Data Center Electricity Consumption Increased By About 4% From 2010-2014, A Large Shift From The 24% Percent Increase Estimated From 2005-2010 And The Nearly 90% Increase Estimated From 2000-2005. Energy Use Is Expected To Continue Slightly Increasing In The Near Future, Increasing 4% From 2014-2020, The Same Rate As The Past Five Years. Based On Current Trend Estimates, U.s. Data Centers Are Projected To Consume Approximately 73 Billion Kwh In 2020. A Combination Of Efficiency Trends Has Resulted In A Relatively Steady U.s Data Center Electricity Demand Over The Past 5 Years, With Little Growth Expected For The Remainder Of This Decade. Along With The Energy Efficiency Resource Already Achieved, There Are Additional Energy Efficiency Strategies And Technologies That Could Significantly Reduce Data Center Electricity Use Below The Approximately 73 Billion Kwh Demand Projected In 2020. Many Of These Efficiency Strategies Are Already Successfully Employed In Some Data Centers While Others Are Emerging Technologies That Will Be Commercially Available In The Near Future. The Potential Impact From An Adoption Of Additional Energy Efficiency Strategies Is Explored, Which Estimate An Annual Saving In 2020 Up To 33 Billion Kwh, Representing A 45% Reduction In Electricity Demand When Compared To Current Efficiency Trends.textless/ptextgreater</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: High availability and disaster recovery (HADR) are often discussed in highly critical business systems for business function recovery and continuity concerns. With the development of cloud computing, virtual cloud services are perfectly matched to HADR scenarios, and interoperability is a significant aspect to help users to use HADR service across different cloud platforms and providers. In this paper, we present an architectural pattern describing the integration of high availability and disaster recovery. We focus on database cluster replication between private cloud and public cloud environments. This HADR pattern for database cluster replication implements both synchronous and asynchronous replication concurrently for high availability and disaster recovery purposes. To evaluate the effectiveness of this pattern, we simulate a MySQL-database-cluster HADR scenario under three strategies: hot standby, warm standby and cold standby, and analyze the performance, business continuity features and cost. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.</td>

Virtualization Technologies Enable Users To Acquire, Configure And Be Charged On Pay-per-use Basis. However, Cloud Data Centers Mostly Comprise Heterogeneous Commodity Servers Hosting Multiple Virtual Machines (vms) With Potential Various Specifications And Fluctuating Resource Usages, Which May Cause Imbalanced Resource Utilization Within Servers That May Lead To Performance Degradation And Service Level Agreements (slas) Violations. To Achieve Efficient Scheduling, These Challenges Should Be Addressed And Solved By Using Load Balancing Strategies, Which Have Been Proved To Be Np-hard Problem. From Multiple Perspectives, This Work Identifies The Challenges And Analyzes Existing Algorithms For Allocating Vms To Pms In Infrastructure Clouds, Especially Focuses On Load Balancing. A Detailed Classification Targeting Load Balancing Algorithms For Vm Placement In Cloud Data Centers Is Investigated And The Surveyed Algorithms Are Classified According To The Classification.

To solve the formulated MaVMP<br>problem, a novel Memetic Algorithm is proposed. As a potentially large number of feasible solutions at any time is one of the challenges of MaVMP, five selection strategies are evaluated in order to automatically select one solution at each time.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud providers employ sophisticated virtualization techniques and strategies for sharing resources among a large number of largely uncoordinated and mutually untrusted customers. The shared networking environment, in particular, dictates the need for mechanisms to partition network resources among virtual machines. At the same time, the performance of applications deployed over these virtual machines may be heavily impacted by the performance of the underlying network, and therefore by such mechanisms. Nevertheless, due to security and commercial reasons, providers rarely provide detailed information on network organization, performance, and mechanisms employed to regulate it. In addition, the scientific literature only provides a blurred image of the network performance inside the cloud. The few available pioneer works marginally focus on this aspect, use different methodologies, operate in few limited scenarios, or report conflicting results.In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the performance of the internal network of Amazon EC2, performed by adopting a non-cooperative experimental evaluation approach (i.e.¿not relying on provider support). Our aim is to provide a quantitative assessment of the networking performance as a function of the several variables available, such as geographic region, resource price or size. We propose a detailed methodology to perform this kind of analysis, which we believe is essential in a such complex and dynamic environment. During this analysis we have discovered and analyzed the limitations enforced by Amazon over customer traffic in terms of maximum throughput allowed. Thanks to our work it is possible to understand how the complex mechanisms enforced by the provider in order to manage its infrastructure impact the performance perceived by the cloud customers and potentially tamper with monitoring and controlling approaches previously proposed in literature. Leveraging our knowledge of the bandwidth-limiting mechanisms, we then present a clear picture of the maximum throughput achievable in Amazon EC2 network, shedding light on when and how such maximum throughput can be achieved and at which cost.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Data Center systems are required to have high availability in order to meet the continuing needs of the user. If the server or application in which a failure or require maintenance, the virtual machine will be migrated to another server in the cluster are still available. The role of shared storage is very important here to keep a virtual machine that can continue the work and do not lose data on the destination server. This study seeks to implement virtualization at the server cluster system uses a virtual machine on Proxmox VE and Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) as shared storage. Implementation is done by using two nodes, and made a comparison with two other nodes in the cluster system that does not use shared storage. Shared storage works by synchronizing and replication of virtual machine data that can then migrate online. The use of shared storage will affect virtual machine performance, especially on the speed of the disk during the process of sending and receiving data, and the availability of services. Measurement of downtime during the migration to test the success of the system. Testing the TCP connection is made to ensure the network throughput and connection test results compared to test disk performance.</td>

The pervasiveness and power of cloud computing alleviates some of the problems that application administrators face in their existing hardware and locally managed software environments. However, the rapid increase in scale, dynamicity, heterogeneity, and diversity of cloud resources necessitates having expert knowledge about programming complex orchestration operations (for example, selection, deployment, monitoring, and runtime control) on those resources to achieve the desired quality of service. This article provides an overview of the key cloud resource types and resource orchestration operations, with special focus on research issues involved in programming those operations.</td>

We present a case study where an enterprise application was developed and deployed in the cloud using a monolithic approach and a microservice architecture using the Play web framework. We show the results of performance tests executed on both applications, and we describe the benefits and challenges that existing enterprises can get and face when they implement microservices in their applications.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: With The Recent Development Of Cloud Computing, The Amount Of Information To Be Processed In Data Centers Has Increased In Recent Years, Which Promotes The Construction Of New Data Centers. Modular Data Center, Which Is Often Packaged In Standard Shipping Formats, Has Been Introduced To Construct And Deploy Data Centers More Quickly And Less Expensively Than Conventional Data Centers. To Conserve Cooling Costs In Modular Data Centers, A Hot Aisle/cold Aisle Arrangement Of The It Racks Is Employed By Dividing The Top Of The Racks Using The Partition. However, Dividing The Top Of The Racks Increases The Pressure Loss Of The Server Fans, Leading To The Increase Of The Server Fan Power. To Examine The Impact Of This Effect On Annual Cooling Power, We Perform Simulations Of Power Consumption In Modular Data Center That Introduces Outside Air And Louvers On The Top Of The Racks. By Varying The Opening Of The Louver As A Function Of The Outside Air Temperature And Rack Power, An Operation To Minimize The Power Consumption Of The Outside Air Fans And Server Fans Is Performed. We Find That Total Cooling Power In Case Where The Louver Is Operated So As To Minimize The Total Cooling Power Can Be Reduced Than That In Case Where The Louver Is Fully Closed By About 5% (10 For 10kw (20kw) Rack Power. We Discuss That The Popular Method For Calculating Energy Efficiency In Data Centers, I.e. Power Usage Effectiveness (pue), Defined By The Ratio Of Total Amount Of Energy Used To The Energy Used In It Equipment, Is Probably Incomplete Metric. Therefore, We Finally Propose That A Revised Pue That Removes The Server Fan Power From It Equipment Energy, And It Should Be Used To Estimate The Energy Efficiency To Avoid The Wrong Interpretation.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud Data Centers and Cost Modeling establishes a framework for strategic decision-makers to facilitate the development of cloud data centers. Just as building a house requires a clear understanding of the blueprints, architecture, and costs of the project; building a cloud-based data center requires similar knowledge. The authors take a theoretical and practical approach, starting with the key questions to help uncover needs and clarify project scope. They then demonstrate probability tools to test and support decisions, and provide processes that resolve key issues. After laying a foundation of cloud concepts and definitions, the book addresses data center creation, infrastructure development, cost modeling, and simulations in decision-making, each part building on the previous. In this way the authors bridge technology, management, and infrastructure as a service, in one complete guide to data centers that facilitates educated decision making.Explains how to balance cloud computing functionality with data center efficiencyCovers key requirements for power management, cooling, server planning, virtualization, and storage managementDescribes advanced methods for modeling cloud computing cost including Real Option Theory and Monte Carlo SimulationsBlends theoretical and practical discussions with insights for developers, consultants, and analysts considering data center development</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This paper proposes an approach to support cloud brokers finding optimal configurations in the deployment of dependability and security sensitive cloud applications. The approach is based on model-driven principles and uses both UML and Bayesian Networks to capture, analyse and optimise cloud deployment configurations. While the paper is most focused on the initial allocation phase, the approach is extensible to the operational phases of the life-cycle. In such a way, a continuous improvement of cloud applications may be realised by monitoring, enforcing and re-negotiating cloud resources following detected anomalies and failures.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Modern Cloud Data Centers exploit virtualization for efficient resource management to reduce cloud computational cost and energy budget. Virtualization empowered by virtual machine (VM) migration meets the ever increasing demands of dynamic workload by relocating VMs within Cloud Data Centers. VM migration helps successfully achieve various resource management objectives such as load balancing, power management, fault tolerance, and system maintenance. However, being resource-intensive, the VM migration process rigorously affects application performance unless attended by smart optimization methods. Furthermore, a Cloud Data Centre exploits server consolidation and DVFS methods to optimize energy consumption. This paper reviews state-of-the-art bandwidth optimization schemes, server consolidation frameworks, DVFS-enabled power optimization, and storage optimization methods over WAN links. Through a meticulous literature review of state-of-the-art live VM migration schemes, thematic taxonomies are proposed to categorize the reported literature. The critical aspects of virtual machine migration schemes are investigated through a comprehensive analysis of the existing schemes. The commonalties and differences among existing VM migration schemes are highlighted through a set of parameters derived from the literature. Finally, open research issues and trends in the VM migration domain that necessitate further consideration to develop optimal VM migration schemes are highlighted.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The Electricity Cost Of Cloud Computing Data Centers, Dominated By Server Power And Cooling Power, Is Growing Rapidly. To Tackle This Problem, Inlet Air With Moderate Temperature And Server Consolidation Are Widely Adopted. However, The Benefit Of These Two Methods Is Limited Due To Conventional Air Cooling System Ineffectiveness Caused By Recirculation And Low Heat Capacity. To Address This Problem, Hybrid Air And Liquid Cooling, As A Practical And Inexpensive Approach, Has Been Introduced. In This Paper, We Quantitatively Analyze The Impact Of Server Consolidation And Temperature Of Cooling Water On The Total Electricity And Server Maintenance Costs In Hybrid Cooling Data Centers. To Minimize The Total Costs, We Proposed To Maintain Sweet Temperature And Available Sleeping Time Threshold (astt) By Which A Joint Cost Optimization Can Be Satisfied. By Using Real-world Traces, The Potential Savings Of Sweet Temperature And Astt Are Estimated To Be Average 23% Of The Total Cost, While 96% Requests Are Satisfied Compared To A Strategy Which Only Reduces Electricity Cost. The Co-optimization Is Extended To Increase The Benefit Of The Renewable Energy, And Its Profit Grows As More Wind Power Is Supplied.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Infrastructure As A Service (iaas) Has Become One Of The Most Dominant Features That Cloud Computing Offers Nowadays. Iaas Enables Datacenter&rsquo;s Hardware To Get Virtualized Which Allows Cloud Providers To Create Multiple Virtual Machine (vm) Instances On A Single Physical Machine, Thus Improving Resource Utilization And Increasing The Return On Investment (roi). Vm Consolidation Includes Issues Like Choosing Appropriate Algorithm For Selection Of Vms For Migration And Placement Of Vms To Suitable Hosts. Vms Need To Be Migrated From Overutilized Host To Guarantee That Demand For Computer Resources And Performance Requirements Are Accomplished. Besides, They Need To Be Migrated&nbsp;from Underutilized Host To Deactivate That Host For Saving Power Consumption. In Order To Solve The Problem Of Energy And Performance, Efficient Dynamic Vm Consolidation Approach Is Introduced In Literature. In This Work, We Have Proposed Multiple Redesigned Vm Placement Algorithms And Introduced A Technique By Clustering Vms To Migrate By Taking Account Both Cpu Utilization And Allocated Ram. We Implement And Study The Performance Of Our Algorithms On A Cloud Computing Simulation Toolkit Known As Cloudsim Using Planetlab Workload Data. Simulation Results Demonstrate That Our Proposed Techniques Outperform The Default Vm Placement Algorithm Designed In Cloudsim.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtual machine consolidation aims at reducing the number of active physical servers in a data center, with the goal to reduce the total power consumption. In this context, most of the existing solutions rely on aggressive virtual machine migration, thus resulting in unnecessary overhead and energy wastage. This article presents a virtual machine consolidation algorithm with usage prediction (VMCUP) for improving the energy efficiency of cloud data centers. Our algorithm is executed during the virtual machine consolidation process to estimate the short-term future CPU utilization based on the local history of the considered servers. The joint use of current and predicted CPU utilization metrics allows a reliable characterization of overloaded and under loaded servers, thereby reducing both the load and the power consumption after consolidation. We evaluate our proposed solution through simulations on real workloads from the Planet Lab and the Google Cluster Data datasets. In comparison with the state of the art, the obtained results show that consolidation with usage prediction reduces the total migrations and the power consumption of the servers while complying with the service level agreement. © 2015 IEEE.</td>

In These Structures, The Massive Heat Generation Of The Processor Results In A High Operating Temperature And A High Refresh Rate Of The Dram. Thus, In The 3d Dram Over Processor Architecture, Temperature-aware Refresh Management Is Necessary. However, Temperature Determination Is Difficult, Because In The 3d Dram, The Temperature Changes Dynamically And Temperature Variation In A Dram Die Is Complicated. In This Paper, A Thermal Guard-band Set-up Method For The 3d Stacked Dram Is Proposed. It Considers The Latency Of The Temperature Data And The Position Difference Between The Temperature Sensor And The Dram Cell. With This Method, The Data Reliability Of The On-chip Temperature Sensor Dependent Adaptive Refresh Control Is Guaranteed. In Addition, An Efficient Temperature Sensor Built-in And Refresh Control Method Is Analyzed. The Expected Refresh Power Reduction Is Examined Through A Simulation.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Global Need Of Computing Is Growing Day By Day And As A Result Cloud Based Services Are Getting More Prominent For Its Pay-as-you-go Modality. However, Cloud Based Datacenters Consume Considerable Amount Of Energy Which Draws Negative Attention. To Sustain The Growth Of Cloud Computing, Energy Consumption Is Now A Major Concern For Cloud Based Datacenters. To Overcome This Problem, Cloud Computing Algorithm Should Be Efficient Enough To Keep Energy Consumption Low And At The Same Time Provide Desired Qos. Virtual Machine Consolidation Is One Such Technique To Ensure Energy-qos Balance. In This Research, We Explored Fuzzy Logic And Heuristic Based Virtual Machine Consolidation Approach To Achieve Energy-qos Balance. Fuzzy Vm Selection Method Has Been Proposed To Select Vm From An Overloaded Host. Additionally, We Incorporated Migration Control In Fuzzy Vm Selection Method. We Have Used Cloudsim Toolkit To Simulate Our Experiment And Evaluate The Performance Of The Proposed Algorithm On Real-world Work Load Traces Of Planetlab Vms. Simulation Results Demonstrate That The Proposed Method Provides Best Performance In All Performance Metrics While Consuming Least Energy.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Environmental footprint resulting from datacenters activities can be reduced by both energy efficiency and renewable energy in a complementary fashion thanks to cloud computing paradigms. In a cloud hosting multi-tenant applications, virtual service providers can be provided with real-time recommendation techniques to allocate their virtual resources in edge, core, or access layers in an optimal way to minimize costs and footprint. Such a dynamic technique requires a flexible and optimized networking scheme to enable elastic virtual tenants spanning multiple physical nodes. In this paper, we investigate an environment-aware paradigm for virtual slices that allows improving energy efficiency and dealing with intermittent renewable power sources. A virtual slice consists of optimal flows assigned to virtual machines (VMs) in a virtual data center taking into account traffic requirements, VM locations, physical network capacity, and renewable energy availability. Considering various cloud consolidation schemes, we formulate and then propose an optimal solution for virtual slice assignment problem. Simulations on the GSN showed that the proposed model achieves better performance than the existing methods with respect to network footprint reductions.</td>

In this paper, we take the virtual machine failure and host failure in OpenStack into consideration. The ability of fast restoration of this service is achieved by components in OpenStack which is called ceilometer and new components named Senlin. The function is achieved by adding patches and modifying the source code in OpenStack. Ceilometer plays a role of collecting information of the virtual machine failure and host failure in OpenStack and transfers this information to Senlin. Then Senlin can make a decision to restore the failure. This clever method achieves the high availability of OpenStack. We implement the proposed method and show the effectiveness of fast restoration.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This book starts with the basic premise that a service is comprised of the 3Ps—products, processes, and people. Moreover, these entities and their sub-entities interlink to support the services that end users require to run and support a business. This widens the scope of any availability design far beyond hardware and software. It also increases the potential for service failure for reasons beyond just hardware and software; the concept of logical outages.High Availability IT Services details the considerations for designing and running highly available ''services'' and not just the systems infrastructure that supports those services. Providing an overview of virtualization and cloud computing, it supplies a detailed look at availability, redundancy, fault tolerance, and security. It also stresses the importance of human factors.The book starts off by providing an availability primer and detailing the reasons why you need to be concerned with high availability. Next, it outlines the theory of reliability and availability and the elements of actual practices in this high availability (HA) area, including Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Change Management.Examining what the major hardware and software vendors have to offer in the HA world, the book considers the ubiquitous world of clouds and virtualization as well as the availability considerations they present.The book examines high availability concepts and architectures such as reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS); clusters; grids; and redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) storage. It also covers the role of security in providing high availability, cluster offerings, emergent Linux clusters, online transaction processing (OLTP), and relational databases.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Although Cloud Computing Has Been Transformational To The It Industry, It Is Built On Large Data Centres That Often Consume Massive Amounts Of Electrical Power. Efforts Have Been Made To Reduce The Energy Clouds Consume, With Certain Data Centres Now Approaching A Power Usage Effectiveness (pue) Factor Of 1.08. While This Is An Incredible Mark, It Also Means That The It Infrastructure Accounts For A Large Part Of The Power Consumed By A Data Centre. Hence, Means To Monitor And Analyse How Energy Is Spent Have Never Been So Crucial. Such Monitoring Is Required Not Only For Understanding How Power Is Consumed, But Also For Assessing The Impact Of Energy Management Policies. In This Article, We Draw Lessons From Experience On Monitoring Large-scale Systems And Introduce An Energy Monitoring Software Framework Called Kilo Watt Api (kwapi), Able To Handle Open-stack Clouds. The Framework - Whose Architecture Is Scalable, Extensible, And Completely Integrated Into Open Stack - Supports Several Wattmeter Devices, Multiple Measurement Formats, And Minimises Communication Overhead.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtualization is one of the most fascinating techniques because it can facilitate the infrastructure management and provide isolated execution for running workloads. Despite the benefits gained from virtualization and resource sharing, improved resource utilization is still far from settled due to the dynamic resource requirements and the widely-used over-provision strategy for guaranteed QoS. Additionally, with the emerging demands for big data analytic, how to effectively manage hybrid workloads such as traditional batch task and long-running virtual machine (VM) service needs to be dealt with. In this paper, we propose a system to combine long-running VM service with typical batch workload like MapReduce. The objectives are to improve the holistic cluster utilization through dynamic resource adjustment mechanism for VM without violating other batch workload executions. Furthermore, VM migration is utilized to ensure high availability and avoid potential performance degradation. The experimental results reveal that the dynamically allocated memory is close to the real usage with only 10&#37; estimation margin, and the performance impact on VM and MapReduce jobs are both within 1%. Additionally, at most 50&#37; increment of resource utilization could be achieved. We believe that these findings are in the right direction to solving workload consolidation issues in hybrid computing environments.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The Objective Of This Paper Is To Develop A Better Understanding Of What Drives Small And Medium-sized Enterprises (smes) To Engage In Environmental Practices, And Whether The Drivers Differ Across Types Of Practices. Two Types Of Environmental Practices Are Distinguished: Practices Related To Production Processes (greening Processes) And Practices Related To Products And Services (greening Product And Service Offerings). Despite A Growing Literature On Socially Responsible Behavior Of Large Firms, The Role Of Smes Remains Underexposed. This Neglect Is Remarkable Given The Substantial Impact Of Smes On The Economy And The Natural Environment. By Using Unique Data For Almost 8,000 Smes Across 12 Sectors In 36 Countries, We Study The Influence Of Firm Characteristics On Smes&rsquo; Environmental Behavior. Our Results Suggest That Different Characteristics Have Dissimilar Influences On Both Types Of Environmental Practices Such As The Type Of Customers Served. Stringent Environmental Legislation Encourages Firms To Actively Take On Environmental Activities, But Only In Case Of Green Products And Services. Moreover, The Dominant Idea That Small Firms Are Reluctant To Invest In Environmental Practices Is Clearly More Nuanced: Firm Size Matters Most For Engagement In Greening Processes. Finally, Smes Active In Tangible Sectors And That Receive Financial Support Are More Involved In Either Type Of Environmental Practices.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: With the advancement of Cloud Computing over the past few years, there has been a massive shift from traditional data centers to cloud enabled data centers. The enterprises with cloud data centers are focusing their attention on energy savings through effective utilization of resources. In this work, we propose algorithms which try to minimize the energy consumption in the data center duly maintaining the SLA guarantees. The algorithms try to utilize least number of physical machines in the data center by dynamically rebalancing the physical machines based on their resource utilization. The algorithms also perform an optimal consolidation of virtual machines on a physical machine, minimizing SLA violations. In extensive simulation, our algorithms achieve savings of about 21&#37; in terms of energy consumption and in terms of maintaining the SLAs, it performs 60&#37; better than Single Threshold algorithm.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Applications are increasingly being deployed in the cloud due to benefits stemming from economy of scale, scalability, flexibility and utility-based pricing model. Although most cloud-based applications have hitherto been enterprise-style, there is an emerging need for hosting real-time streaming applications in the cloud that demand both high availability and low latency. Contemporary cloud computing research has seldom focused on solutions that provide both high availability and real-time assurance to these applications in a way that also optimizes resource consumption in data centers, which is a key consideration for cloud providers. This paper makes three contributions to address this dual challenge. First, it describes an architecture for a fault-tolerant framework that can be used to automatically deploy replicas of virtual machines in data centers in a way that optimizes resources while assuring availability and responsiveness. Second, it describes the design of a pluggable framework within the fault-tolerant architecture that enables plugging in different placement algorithms for VM replica deployment. Third, it illustrates the design of a framework for real-time dissemination of resource utilization information using a real-time publish/subscribe framework, which is required by the replica selection and placement framework. Experimental results using a case study that involves a specific replica placement algorithm are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of our architecture.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: As Linux on System z becomes more prevalent and mainstream in the industry, the need for it to deliver higher levels of availability is increasing. This IBM Redbooks publication starts with an explanation of high availability (HA) fundamentals such as HA concepts and terminology. It continues with a discussion of why a business needs to consider an HA solution and then explains how to determine your business single points of failure. We outline the components of a high availability solution and describe these components. Then we provide some architectural scenarios and demonstrate how to plan and decide an implementation of an end-to-end HA solution, from Linux on System z database scenarios to z/OS, and include storage, network, z/VM, Linux, and middleware. This implementation includes the IBM Tivoli System Automation for Multiplatforms (TSA MP), which monitors and automates applications distributed across Linux, AIX®, and z/OS® operating systems, as well as a GDPS based solution. It includes the planning for an end-to-end scenario, considering Linux on System z, z/VM, and z/OS operating environments, and the middleware used. The TSA MP implements HA for infrastructure, network, operating systems, and applications across multiple platforms and is compared to a Linux HA implementation based on open source Linux-HA, which is Linux only.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing has become a popular metaphor for dynamic and secure self-service access to computational and storage capabilities. In this study, we analyze and model workloads gathered from enterprise-operated commercial private clouds that implement “Infrastructure as a Service.” Our results show that 3-phase hyperexponential distributions fit using the Estimation Maximization (E-M) algorithm capture workload attributes accurately. In addition, these models of individual attributes compose to produce estimates of overall cloud performance that our results verify to be accurate. As an early study of commercial enterprise private clouds, this work provides guidance to those researching, designing, or maintaining such installations. In particular, the cloud workloads under study do not exhibit “heavy-tailed” distributional properties in the same way that “bare metal” operating systems do, potentially leading to different design and engineering tradeoffs.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are a versatile technology that offers the ability to monitor real-world phenomena in detail and at large scale in scenarios where wired infrastructures are inapplicable or expensive. In this paper we present an ad-hoc WSN deployment for indoor environmental quality monitoring in office buildings. The indoor environmental quality and balance between inhabitant comfort level and power demands are the main objectives of this network. The presented system consists of 19 sensor devices continuously measuring vibration, temperature, humidity, light, and carbon dioxide levels in working areas. The power load of the building is measured by dedicated current sensor devices. Preliminary laboratory tests and data sets collected during 4 months of real world operation show that our system provides an accurate monitoring of indoor environmental parameters delivering high data reliability with an estimated lifetime exceeding 1.5 years, without the gas sensors. The paper presents the HW/SW architecture, the network infrastructure of the deployment and analyzes real measurement data.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Power and performance tradeoffs are critical and challenging issues faced by cloud service providers (CSPs) while managing their data centers. On the one hand, CSPs strive to reduce power consumption of their data centers to not only decrease their energy costs but to also reduce adverse impact on the environment. On the other hand, CSPs must deliver performance expected by the applications hosted in their cloud in accordance with predefined Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Not doing so will lead to loss of customers and thereby major revenue losses for the CSPs. Addressing these dual set of challenges is hard for the CSPs because power management and performance assurance are conflicting objectives, particularly in the context of multi-tenant cloud systems where multiple virtual machines (VMs) may be hosted on a single physical server. The problem becomes even harder when real-time applications are hosted in these VMs. To address these challenges and make appropriate tradeoffs, we present iPlace, which is an intelligent and tunable power- and performance-aware VM placement middleware. The placement strategy is based on a two-level artificial neural network which predicts (1) CPU usage at the first level, and (2) power consumption and performance of a host machine at the second level that uses the predicted CPU usage. The efficacy of iPlace is evaluated in the context of a VM consolidation algorithm that is applied to running virtual machines and host machines in a private cloud.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud service providers enable enterprises with the ability to place their business applications into availability zones across multiple locations worldwide. While this capability helps achieve higher availability with smaller failure rates, business applications deployed across these independent zones may experience different Quality of Service (QoS) due to heterogeneous physical infrastructures. Since the perceived QoS against specific requirements are not usually advertised by cloud providers, selecting an availability zone that would best satisfy the user requirements is a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a predictive approach to identify the cloud availability zone that maximizes satisfaction of an incoming request against a set of requirements. The predictive models are built from historical usage data for each availability zone and are updated as the nature of the zones and requests change. Simulation results show that our method successfully predicts the unpublished zone behavior from historical data and identifies the availability zone that maximizes user satisfaction against specific requirements.</td>

Abstract. In cloud computing environments it is important to keep under control the allocation of virtual machines in physical servers. A good allocation brings benefits such as reduction costs in hardware, power, and cooling, also improving the quality of service. Recent hypervisors implement mechanisms to reduce RAM consumption by sharing identical pages between virtual machines. This paper presents a new algorithm for virtual machines allocation that seeks the balanced use of CPU, memory, disk, and network. In addition, it considers the potential for sharing memory among virtual machines. Simulations on three distinct scenarios demonstrate that it is superior to the standard approach when considering the balanced use of resources. Considering shared memory, there was an appreciable gain in availability of resources.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: With the emerging of many data centers around the globe, heavy loads of large-scale commercial and scientific applications executed in the cloud call for efficient cloud resource management strategies to save energy without compromising the performance and system throughput. According to the statistics from the Data Centre Dynamic (DCD) organization, the expected energy consumption by computer servers would increase by 19&#37; in 2013 compared with the previous year. Such trend may continue for many years. Moreover, the estimated energy consumption of computers in the U.S. was about 2&#37; out of the total electricity consumption in 2010, which makes IT industry the second pollution contributor after aviation. In this paper, a novel approach for scheduling, sharing and migrating Virtual Machines (VMs) for a bag of cloud tasks is designed and developed to reduce energy consumption with guaranteed certain execution time and high system throughput. This approach is derived from an Enhanced First Fit Decreasing (EFFD) algorithm combined with our VM reuse strategy. Furthermore, virtual machine migration method is introduced to dynamically monitor the cloud situation for necessary migration. Our simulation results using Cloud Report show that EFFD with our VM reuse strategy gains higher resource utilization rate and lower energy consumption than Greedy, Round Robin (RR) and FDD without VM reuse.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing a big pool of resources dynamically reconfigures its resources as per user requirement in real time. Cloud environment mostly works with virtualized environment, which is a key consideration for providing virtual machines as a service to the users. It is difficult to manage virtual machine, and to deploy on any data centers. In cloud environment users expects better services from the vendors, in order to improve resource utilization. The factors in cloud environment as if scalability and availability are consider for better outcomes for users. This not only saves time, but also improves cost utilization. This paper proposes architecture, based on clustering virtual machines in datacenters for higher availability of resources with improved scalability. Clustering helps virtual machines to reconfigure and easy scheduling. The resource sharing in cloud will optimize and users get maximized result. Further, the paper directs a mathematical model for explaining the concepts of the proposed system. The existing system is being modulated using simulation tools and further elaborated in the paper.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Fifty-seven Percent Of Us Servers Are Housed In Server Closets, Server Rooms, And Localized Data Centers, In What Are Commonly Referred To As Small Server Rooms, Which Comprise 99textbackslash% Of All Server Spaces In The Us. While Many Mid-tier And Enterprise-class Data Centers Are Owned By Large Corporations That Consider Energy Efficiency A Goal To Minimize Business Operating Costs, Small Server Rooms Typically Are Not Similarly Motivated. They Are Characterized By Decentralized Ownership And Management And Come In Many Configurations, Which Creates A Unique Set Of Efficiency Challenges. To Develop Energy Efficiency Strategies For These Spaces, We Surveyed 30 Small Server Rooms Across Eight Institutions, And Selected Four Of Them For Detailed Assessments. The Four Rooms Had Power Usage Effectiveness (pue) Values Ranging From 1.5 To 2.1. Energy Saving Opportunities Ranged From No- To Low-cost Measures Such As Raising Cooling Set Points And Better Airflow Management, To More Involved But Cost-effective Measures Including Server Consolidation And Virtualization, And Dedicated Cooling With Economizers. We Found That Inefficiencies Mainly Resulted From Organizational Rather Than Technical Issues. Because Of The Inherent Space And Resource Limitations, The Most Effective Measure Is To Operate Servers Through Energy-efficient Cloud-based Services Or Well-managed Larger Data Centers, Rather Than Server Rooms. Backup Power Requirement, And It And Cooling Efficiency Should Be Evaluated To Minimize Energy Waste In The Server Space. Utility Programs Are Instrumental In Raising Awareness And Spreading Technical Knowledge On Server Operation, And The Implementation Of Energy Efficiency Measures In Small Server Rooms.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Data Centers Consume A Significant Amount Of Energy In The Us And Worldwide, Much Of Which Is Consumed By The Cooling Infrastructure, Particularly The Chiller Plant And Computer Room Air Conditioners And Air Handlers. To Enable Energy Efficient Data Center Designs, Ashrae Added Two New It Environmental Classes, A3 And A4, With Associated Allowable Inlet Air Temperatures Of 40c And 45c Respectively. It Equipment That Meet These New Allowable Environmental Envelopes Can Operate In Data Centers With Minimal Refrigeration Cooling And Instead Rely On Ambient Free Cooling. In This Paper We Investigate The Impact Of Allowing A Data Center To Operate Up To The A3 Limit Of 40c On Total Data Center Energy Use For 3 Different Types Of Servers In A Chiller-less Data Center Located In A Variety Of Locations. The Study Finds That Though Facility Power Reduces As The Demand For Cold Air Reduces, The Increase In It Power Consumption, Due To Fan Speed-up, Can Offset These Savings And In Some Cases Result In An Overall Increase In Data Center Power. Thus The Most Energy Efficient Operating Point Is Dependant On The Specific Energy Use Profiles Of The Infrastructure And The It Equipment. The Higher Allowable Temperature Can Also Result In Higher Failure Rates And An Increased Risk Of Equipment Or Service Loss Due To Data Center Cooling Failures. This Paper Also Presents A Study On The Potential For Chiller Elimination And Chiller Use Reduction Across The Us, Europe And In India By Operating In The Various Ashrae Envelopes. For Wet, Water Side Economized Data Centers, A2 And A3 Equipment Is Sufficient To Almost Completely Remove The Need For Chillers In Many Geographic Locations.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Workload And Resource Management Are Two Essential Functions Provided At The Service Level Of The Distributed Systems Infrastructure. To Improve The Global Throughput Of These Software Environments, Workloads Have To Be Evenly Scheduled Among The Available Resources. To Realize This Goal, Several Load Balancing Strategies And Algorithms Have Been Proposed. Most O F T H E S E Strategies Were Developed Assuming Homogeneous Set Of Sites Linked With Homogeneous And Fast Networks. However, For Computational Grids, We Must Address Some New Issues, Namely: Heterogeneity, Scalability And Adaptability. In This Paper, We Propose A Decentralized Cluster-based Algorithm Which Achieves Dynamic Load Balancing In The Cloud Architecture. The Proposed Algorithm Presents The Following Main Features: (i) It Supports Heterogeneity, (ii) Scalability, (iii) Low Network Congestion And (iv) Absence Of Any Bottleneck Node Due To Its Decentralized Nature. Simulation Results Using Cloudsim Show The Performance Analysis Of The Algorithm For Patronizing Our Claims About The Load Balancing Achieved In The System.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud Computing Is Novel Technology, Which Enables Any Resource As Service On Demand. Cloud Environment Motivates Highly Dynamic Resource Provisioning. Hence Clients Can Scale Up Or Scale Down Their Requirements As Per Their Demand. Load Balancing Is Very Important And Complex Problem In Cloud Environment, Because Of Its Heterogeneity Of The Computing Nodes. In Order To Realize The Full Potential Of Cloud Computing It Is Vital To Minimize Energy Consumption Along With Effective Load Balancing. The Aim Of Energy Aware Load Balancing (ealb) Model Is To Minimize Energy Consumption With Load Balancing. Ealb Model Classifies The Incoming Job Request Either Cpu Bound Or I/o Bound According To Their Purpose And Behaviour. This Classification Details Are Maintained In A Table Named Pattern History Table (pht) And Organized As Hash Table. One Of The Virtual Machine (vm) Is Selected Dynamically Based On Best Fit Allocation Policy And The Job Is Assigned To The Victimized Vm. From The Pattern History Table Job's Nature Is Identified. Using Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (dvfs) Scheme The Selected Vm's Processor Clock Frequency Is Increased If It Is Found Cpu Bound Else Decreased (i/o Bound). Thus, Ealb Algorithm Saves Considerable Amount Of Energy And Proves To Be More Efficient.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Localisation Or Position Determination Is One Of The Most Important Applications For The Wireless Sensor Networks. Numerous Current Techniques For Localisation Of Sensor Nodes Use The Received Signal Strength Indicator (rssi) From Sensor Nodes Because Of Its Simplicity And Cost. Non-linearities In Rssi Circuits, The Antenna Radiation Pattern And Path Loss Model Parameter Estimation May Result In Accuracy Of The Localisation Algorithm. Therefore, Environmental Characterisation Of Radio Propagation Basic Mechanisms Is A Fundamental Step Toward The Design Of Ranging And Localisation Algorithms Able To Work Properly In Realistic Scenarios. Furthermore, Positioning Systems Are Migrating Towards Hybridisation Where Data Coming From Heterogeneous Technologies Are Fused To Improve Localisation Accuracy And Coverage. This Paper Presents An Improved Mathematical Model For Ranging Using Rssi In Realistic Practical Scenarios As Well As Measurement Methodologies To Use During Calibration Experiments In Order To Quantify Each Parameter Involved In A Localisation Algorithm Using A Sensor Data Fusion Approach.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: With the pressing regulatory requirement to increase energy efficiency in our built environment, significant researching efforts have been recently directed towards energy optimisation with the overall objective of reducing energy consumption. Energy simulation and optimisation identify a class of applications that demand high performance processing power in order to be realised within a feasible time-frame. The problem becomes increasingly complex when undertaking such energy simulation and optimisation in large scale buildings such as sport facilities where the generation of optimal set points can be timing inefficient. In this paper we present how a modular based optimisation system can be efficiently used for running energy simulation and optimisation in order to fulfil a number of energy related objectives. The solution can address the variability in building dynamics and provide support for building managers in implementing energy efficient optimisation plans. We present the optimisation system that has been implemented based on energy saving specifications from EU FP7 project – SportE2 (Energy Efficiency for Sport Facilities) and evaluate the efficiency of the system over a number of relevant use-case scenarios.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Operational Expenses Of Servers And The Data Center To Support Them Account For A Significant Part Of The Total Cost Of Ownership Of A Data Center And Potentially The Total Business. Manipulating The Inlet Temperature To The Servers Can Provide A Possible Method Of Lowering The Operating Cost Of A Data Center. Conventional Wisdom Regarding Management Of The Cold Aisle Temperature In The Data Center Has Traditionally Been That Colder Temperatures Kept The Failure Rate Of The Equipment Down And Higher Temperatures Reduced Energy Costs. While It Is True That In Most Cooling Strategies, Increasing The Cold Aisle Set Point Temperature Reduces The Power Consumed By The Facilities, The Overall Cost Savings May Not Be Realized Due To Increases In Server Power And Decreased Reliability. An Investigation Using The Total Operational Expense Of The Data Center Would Be Required To Find The Optimum Operating Point Of The Environmental Controls. The Simulation Described In This Paper Demonstrates That When Accounting For Total Operational Cost Including Component Reliability And Servicing In Addition To Energy And Water Resource Costs, There Is An Optimal Data Center Cold Aisle Set Point. This Point Will Vary With Resource Rates And Climate Variations. The Run Cost Effectiveness Metric, Rce, Allows Data Center Designers And Managers To Monitor And Optimize Their Data Center For The Given Static Costs Of The Region. It's A Measurable Value For Many Data Centers That Can Break Out These Costs Either In Real Time, Or More Likely Tabulated Form Collected From Monitoring Data Over Time.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We Propose In This Paper To Study The Energy-, Thermal- And Performance-aware Resource Management In Heterogeneous Datacenters. Witnessing The Continuous Development Of Heterogeneity In Datacenters, We Are Confronted With Their Different Behaviors In Terms Of Performance, Power Consumption And Thermal Dissipation: Indeed, Heterogeneity At Server Level Lies Both In The Computing Infrastructure (computing Power, Electrical Power Consumption) And In The Heat Removal Systems (different Enclosure, Fans, Thermal Sinks). Also The Physical Locations Of The Servers Become Important With Heterogeneity Since Some Servers Can (over)heat Others. While Many Studies Address Independently These Parameters (most Of The Time Performance And Power Or Energy), We Show In This Paper The Necessity To Tackle All These Aspects For An Optimal Resource Management Of The Computing Resources. This Leads To Improved Energy Usage In A Heterogeneous Datacenter Including The Cooling Of The Computer Rooms. We Build Our Approach On The Concept Of Heat Distribution Matrix To Handle The Mutual Influence Of The Servers, In Heterogeneous Environments, Which Is Novel In This Context. We Propose A Heuristic To Solve The Server Placement Problem And We Design A Generic Greedy Framework For The Online Scheduling Problem. We Derive Several Single-objective Heuristics (for Performance, Energy, Cooling) And A Novel Fuzzy-based Priority Mechanism To Handle Their Tradeoffs. Finally, We Show Results Using Extensive Simulations Fed With Actual Measurements On Heterogeneous Servers.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: As the important measure to ensure the high availability of campus virtual data center, virtual machine hot standby has got comprehensive attention. For low availability caused by intrinsic memory copying technology, this paper proposes pre-transfer based on memory selection algorithm and stoptransfer based on memory compression algorithm. A part of memory pages are pre-transferred during the primary virtual machine running, to reduce the number of transferred memory pages in downtime. Meanwhile, on the basis of program locality, predict the dirty pages rate and pre-transfer dirty pages whose rate are low to refrain from duplicate transmission at the stage of stop-transfer. To stoptransfer, improved memory compression algorithm is used to compress the memory pages on the purpose of enhancing the efficiency of stop transmission. The simulation result shows that the downtime of improved Remus system decreases obviously compared with the original Remus in Xen, especially in the situation of high dirty pages rate and long time interval.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Data Centers Power Consumption Corresponds To Near 2% Of The Total World Wide Power Consumption, With Constantly Increasing Greenhouse Effect And Co2 Footprints. Virtualization Techniques Improve The Efficiency Of Data Centers Infrastructure Sharing A Same Physical Hardware Among Several Virtual Machines (vms). An Efficient Vm Placement Can Minimize Even Further The Hardware And Energy Needs. In Contrast To Existing Vm Placement Algorithms That Usually Focus On A Single Resource Or Assumes That Resources Demands Are Deterministic, This Paper Proposes And Compares Four Energy-aware Algorithms That Consider Multiple Stochastic Resources, Including Network Bandwidth. We First Formulate The Problem As A Multi Objective Optimization Problem With Stochastic Resources And We Present Two Algorithms Based On This Approach. We Also Formulate The Problem As An Evolutionary Computation Problem And We Present Two Algorithms Based On This Approach. The Objective Is A Joint Strategy: Minimize The Required Hardware To Maximize The Allocated Vms Satisfying The Resource Requirements. Through Simulations, We Compare Our Algorithms Using Real Vms Workloads From The Planetlab Project And Showed The Significant Improvements On Power Consumption And Network Utilization. In Average, The Algorithms Reduce Power Consumption By 87.90% And The Network Utilization By 9.94%.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Accurately Determining The Energy Consumed By Each Task In A System Will Become Of Prominent Importance In Future Multicore-based Systems Because It Offers Several Benefits, Including (i) Better Application Energy/performance Optimizations, (ii) Improved Energy-aware Task Scheduling, And (iii) Energy-aware Billing In Data Centers. Unfortunately, Existing Methods For Energy Metering In Multicores Fail To Provide Accurate Energy Estimates For Each Task When Several Tasks Run Simultaneously. This Article Makes A Case For Accurate Per-task Energy Metering (ptem) Based On Tracking The Resource Utilization And Occupancy Of Each Task. Different Hardware Implementations With Different Trade-offs Between Energy Prediction Accuracy And Hardware-implementation Complexity Are Proposed. Our Evaluation Shows That The Energy Consumed In A Multicore By Each Task Can Be Accurately Measured. For A 32-core, 2-way, Simultaneous Multithreaded Core Setup, Ptem Reduces The Average Accuracy Error From More Than 12% When Our Hardware Support Is Not Used To Less Than 4% When It Is Used. The Maximum Observed Error For Any Task In The Workload We Used Reduces From 58% Down To 9% When Our Hardware Support Is Used.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud Governance, And In Particular Data Governance In The Cloud, Relies On Different Technical And Organizational Practices And Procedures, Such As Policy Enforcement, Risk Management, Incident Management And Remediation. The Concept Of Accountability Encompasses Such Practices, And Is Essential For Enhancing Security And Trustworthiness In The Cloud. Besides This, Proper Measurement Of Cloud Services, Both At A Technical And Governance Level, Is A Distinctive Aspect Of The Cloud Computing Model. Hence, A Natural Problem That Arises Is How To Measure The Impact On Accountability Of The Procedures Held In Practice By Organizations That Participate In The Cloud Ecosystem. In This Paper, We Describe A Metamodel For Addressing The Problem Of Measuring Accountability Properties For Cloud Computing, As Discussed And Defined By The Cloud Accountability Project (a4cloud). The Goal Of This Metamodel Is To Act As A Language For Describing: (i) Accountability Properties In Terms Of Actions Between Entities, And (ii) Metrics For Measuring The Fulfillment Of Such Properties. It Also Allows The Recursive Decomposition Of Properties And Metrics, From A High-level And Abstract World To A Tangible And Measurable One. Finally, We Illustrate Our Proposal Of The Metamodel By Modelling The Transparency Property, And Define Some Metrics For It.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Live migration of virtual machine (VM) enables mobility of VM and contributes to advantages of virtualization like energy saving, high availability, fault tolerance and work load balancing. However solutions of VMs' migration in both theoretical and industrial areas concentrate more on memory migration other than storage migration. Lots of applications with intensive disk I/O operations rely on local storage, especially when it comes to high performance computing. Migration of shared storage is also of necessity for consolidation and workload balance. Current approaches on storage migration can hardly work effectively in disk I/O intensive environment. They cannot reduce migration time and guarantee the disk I/O performance of VMs at the same time. This paper proposes an approach called Partners Assisted Storage Migration (PASM). We are the first to utilize disk I/O ability of pre-allocated storage nodes to relieve the competition between VMs' intensive disk I/O and storage migration. It can migrate VMs' storage effectively comparing to current methods: post-copy and write-mirror. Experiments including single VM's migration and multiple VMs' migration show that PASM can save 78.9&#37; migration time and achieve additional 27.1&#37; in disk I/O performance over existing methods.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Live migration of virtual machine (VM) provides a significant benefit for virtual server mobility without disrupting service. It is widely used for system management in virtualized data centers. However, migration costs may vary significantly for different workloads due to the variety of VM configurations and workload characteristics. To take into account the migration overhead in migration decision-making, we investigate design methodologies to quantitatively predict the migration performance and energy consumption. We thoroughly analyze the key parameters that affect the migration cost from theory to practice. We construct application-oblivious models for the cost prediction by using learned knowledge about the workloads at the hypervisor (also called VMM) level. This should be the first kind of work to estimate VM live migration cost in terms of both performance and energy in a quantitative approach. We evaluate the models using five representative workloads on a Xen virtualized environment. Experimental results show that the refined model yields higher than 90&#37; prediction accuracy in comparison with measured cost. Model-guided decisions can significantly reduce the migration cost by more than 72.9&#37; at an energy saving of 73.6%.</td>

This Paper Proposes Two New Metrics: Itue (it-power Usage Effectiveness), Similar To Pue But &ldquo;inside&rdquo; The It And Tue (total-power Usage Effectiveness), Which Combines The Two For A Total Efficiency Picture.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtual machine(VM) migration usually requires a considerable amount of system resources such as the network bandwidth. In the case of multiple simultaneous migrations, such resource demands will increase dramatically and are difficult to be satisfied immediately. This paper proposes a scheduling method for multiple VM migrations to guarantee the fast completion of those tasks and hence the reduced impacts on system performance. We discover the best bandwidth sharing policy for each network link, and further propose a bin-packing algorithm to organize bandwidth resources from all the network links. As a result, the migration tasks can fully utilize available resources in the whole network to achieve the fast completion.</td>

An Important Part Of This Research Focuses On Motivating Energy Savings By Providing Feedback Tools Which Present Consumption Metrics Interactively. In This Line Of Work, The Configuration Of Feedback Has Been Mainly Discussed Using Cognitive Or Behavioral Factors. This Narrow Focus, However, Misses A Highly Relevant Perspective For The Design Of Technology That Supports Sustainable Lifestyles: To Investigate The Multiplicity Of Forms In Which Individuals Or Collectives Actually Consume Energy. In This Article, We Broaden This Focus, By Taking A Phenomenological Lens To Study How People Use Off-the-shelf Eco-feedback Systems In Private Households To Make Energy Consumption Accountable And Explainable. By Reconstructing Accounting Practices, We Delineate Several Constitutive Elements Of The Phenomenon Of Energy Usage In Daily Life. We Complement These Elements With A Description Of The Sophisticated Methods Used By People To Organize Their Energy Practices And To Give A Meaning To Their Energy Consumption. We Describe These Elements And Methods, Providing Examples Coming From The Fieldwork And Uncovering Observed Strategies To Account For Consumption. Based On Our Results, We Provide A Critical Perspective On Existing Eco-feedback Mechanisms And Describe Several Elements For A Design Rationale For Designing Support For Responsible Energy Consumption. We Argue That Interactive Feedback Systems Should Not Simply Be An End, But Rather A Resource For The Construction Of The Artful Practice Of Making Energy Consumption Accountable.</td>

It allows users to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources. Particularly, once installed and configured, it allows its users to submit and control the life-cycle of a large number of VMs. For scalability, the system relies on a self-organizing hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it implements self-healing mechanisms in case of failure to enable high availability. It also performs energy-efficient distributed VM management through consolidation and power management techniques. This poster focuses on the experimental validation of two main properties of Snooze: scalability and fault-tolerance.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud Computing Is Emerging As A New Paradigm Of Large-scale Distributed Computing. In Order To Utilize The Power Of Cloud Computing Completely, We Need An Efficient Task Scheduling Algorithm. The Traditional Min-min Algorithm Is A Simple, Efficient Algorithm That Produces A Better Schedule That Minimizes The Total Completion Time Of Tasks Than Other Algorithms In The Literature [7]. However The Biggest Drawback Of It Is Load Imbalanced, Which Is One Of The Central Issues For Cloud Providers. In This Paper, An Improved Load Balanced Algorithm Is Introduced On The Ground Of Min-min Algorithm In Order To Reduce The Makespan And Increase The Resource Utilization (lbimm). At The Same Time, Cloud Providers Offer Computer Resources To Users On A Pay-per-use Base. In Order To Accommodate The Demands Of Different Users, They May Offer Different Levels Of Quality For Services. Then The Cost Per Resource Unit Depends On The Services Selected By The User. In Return, The User Receives Guarantees Regarding The Provided Resources. To Observe The Promised Guarantees, User-priority Was Considered In Our Proposed Pa-lbimm So That User's Demand Could Be Satisfied More Completely. At Last, The Introduced Algorithm Is Simulated Using Matlab Toolbox. The Simulation Results Show That The Improved Algorithm Can Lead To Significant Performance Gain And Achieve Over 20% Improvement On Both Vip User Satisfaction And Resource Utilization Ratio.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: First Fit Decreasing is a classical bin-packing algorithm: the items are ordered by non-increasing size, and then in this order the next item is always packed into the first bin where it fits. For an instance L let FFD(L) and OPT(L) denote the number of bins used by algorithm FFD and by an optimal algorithm, respectively. In this paper we give the first complete proof of the inequalityFFD(L)<=11/9×OPT(L)+6/9. This result is best possible, as was shown earlier by D&oacute;sa (2007) [3]. The asymptotic coefficient 11/9 was proved already in 1973 by Johnson, but the tight bound of the additive constant was an open question for four decades. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtualization Is One Of The Key Technologies That Enable Cloud Computing, A Novel Computing Paradigm Aiming At Provisioning On-demand Computing Capacities As Services. With The Special Features Of Self-service And Pay-as-you-use, Cloud Computing Is Attracting Not Only Personal Users But Also Small And Middle Enterprises. By Running Applications On The Cloud, Users Need Not Maintain Their Own Servers Thus To Save Administration Cost. Cloud Computing Uses A Business Model Meaning That The Operation Overhead Must Be A Major Concern Of The Cloud Providers. Today, The Payment Of A Data Centre On Energy May Be Larger Than The Overall Investment On The Computing, Storage And Network Facilities. Therefore, Saving Energy Consumption Is A Hot Topic Not Only In Cloud Computing But Also For Other Domains. This Work Proposes And Implements A Virtual Machine (vm) Scheduling Mechanism That Targets On Both Load-balancing And Temperature-balancing With A Final Goal Of Reducing The Energy Consumption In A Cloud Centre. Using The Strategy Of Vm Migration It Is Ensured That None Of The Physical Hosts Suffers From Either High Temperature Or Over-utilization. The Proposed Scheduling Mechanism Has Been Evaluated On Cloudsim, A Well-known Simulator For Cloud Computing. Initial Experimental Results Show A Significant Benefit In Terms Of Energy Consumption.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Integrating Residential Photovoltaic (pv) Power Generation And Electrical Energy Storage (ees) Systems Into The Smart Grid Is An Effective Way Of Utilizing Renewable Power And Reducing The Consumption Of Fossil Fuels. This Has Become A Particularly Interesting Problem With The Introduction Of Dynamic Electricity Energy Pricing Models Since Electricity Consumers Can Use Their Pv-based Energy Generation And Ees Systems For Peak Shaving On Their Power Demand Profile From The Grid, And Thereby, Minimize Their Electricity Bill. Due To The Characteristics Of A Realistic Electricity Price Function And The Energy Storage Capacity Limitation, The Control Algorithm For A Residential Ees System Should Accurately Account For Various Energy Loss Components During Operation. Hybrid Electrical Energy Storage (hees) Systems Are Proposed To Exploit The Strengths Of Each Type Of Ees Element And Hide Its Weaknesses So As To Achieve A Combination Of Performance Metrics That Is Superior To Those Of Any Of Its Individual Ees Components. This Paper Introduces The Problem Of How Best To Utilize A Hees System For A Residential Smart Grid User Equipped With Pv Power Generation Facilities. The Optimal Control Algorithm For The Hees System Is Developed, Which Aims At Minimization Of The Total Electricity Cost Over A Billing Period Under A General Electricity Energy Price Function. The Proposed Algorithm Is Based On Dynamic Programming And Has Polynomial Time Complexity. Experimental Results Demonstrate That The Proposed Hees System And Optimal Control Algorithm Achieves 73.9% Average Profit Enhancement Over Baseline Homogeneous Ees Systems.</td>

However, The Amount Of Data Generated By These Sensors Is Very Large. As A Result, Analytics Performed On Top Of It Become Very Expensive. Furthermore, Smart Meter Data Contains Very Detailed Energy Consumption Measurement Which Can Lead To Customer Privacy Breach And All Risks Associated With It. In This Work, We Address The Problem On How To Reduce Smart Meter Data Numerosity And Its Detailed Measurement While Maintaining Its Analytics Accuracy. We Convert The Data Into Symbolic Representation And Allow Various Machine Learning Algorithms To Be Performed On Top Of It. In Addition, Our Symbolic Representation Admit An Additional Advantage To Allow Also Algorithms Which Usually Work On Nominal And String To Be Run On Top Of Smart Meter Data. We Provide An Experiment For Classification And Forecasting Tasks Using Real-world Data. And Finally, We Illustrate Several Directions To Extend Our Work Further.</td>

To Overcome These Limitations, We Design And Implement An Enhanced Cloud Simulation Platform Called Dartcsim+ That Supports The Energy-aware Network Simulation And Network-aware Live Migration. Further, We Also Implement A Resubmit Mechanism For Packets Transmission To Provide A More Real Network Behavior To Solve Transmission Failure Which Is Caused By Migration Or Network Failure.

The Open Source Zbfind Tool Estimates Distance To Zigbee Devices In Real Time Using Received Signal Strength And A Distance Prediction Model. We Collect 4500 Signal Strength Measurements Along Nine Walking Paths Toward Zigbee Transmitters In Three Office Buildings.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cloud computing promises customers the on-demand ability to dynamically provision virtualization resources in face of workload variations. Most existing scaling approaches addressed this problem by allocating application to a certain amount of cloud resources. However, the problem of the availability of application influenced by VM-based physical locations during resource scaling process is a serious challenge due to dynamic complex workload and has not been widely discussed yet. In this paper, we present a novel availability-based computing model to describe availability attribute of one application in the hierarchical structured cloud. Moreover, we propose an availability-aware policy by performing both vertical and horizontal scaling to explore how and where to allocate computing resource. Simulation results indicate that our model captured the availability of cloud applications properly and proposed scaling approach achieves the objectives of meeting availability demands and minimizing the total communication cost.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Energy efficiency has now become one of the major design constraints for current and future cloud data center operators. One way to conserve energy is to transition idle servers into a lower power-state (e.g. suspend). Therefore, virtual machine (VM) placement and dynamic VM scheduling algorithms are proposed to facilitate the creation of idle times. However, these algorithms are rarely integrated in a holistic approach and experimentally evaluated in a realistic environment. In this paper we present the energy management algorithms and mechanisms of a novel holistic energy-aware VM management framework for private clouds called Snooze. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the energy and performance implications of our system on 34 power-metered machines of the Grid'5000 experimentation testbed under dynamic web workloads. The results show that the energy saving mechanisms allow Snooze to dynamically scale data center energy consumption proportionally to the load, thus achieving substantial energy savings with only limited impact on application performance.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Driven By Need To Reduce Energy Use, Many New Data Centers Are Built With Air-side Economizers. This Method Of Bringing In Outside Air As The Primary Cooling Resource Greatly Reduces Overall Facility Power By Eliminating Need For The Compressors And Pumps Required By Chilled Water And Refrigerant Based Cooling Systems. However, System Fans Are Still Necessary To Supply And Move Large Amounts Of Air Through The Facility. The Operating Power Of Fans Is Dependent On The Static Pressure Which Must Be Overcome To Move Air. The Static Pressure Of A Data Center Is Generally Fixed For A Given Configuration, With The Exception Of Air Filters Which Become Clogged Over Time. In This Work, Airflow Versus Pressure Drop Curves Of Filters Removed After Eight And A Half Months Of Service In A Large Data Center Operating An Air-side Economizer Are Experimentally Characterized. Comparisons Of This Data Against Clean Filters Provides Insight Into The Change In Pressure Drop Of Both Low-efficiency Pleated Pre-filters And High-efficiency Cartridge Final Filters As They Become Dirty. Incorporating These System Resistance Curves Into The Power Curve Of The Data Center Supply Fans Indicates Only Minimal Increase In Energy Use Resulting From Dust And Particle Collection Of The Filters.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: When The Concept Of Reliability Began To Formally Become An Integrated Engineering Approach In The 50s, Reliability Was Associated With Failure Rate. Today The Term &ldquo;reliability&rdquo; Is Used As An Umbrella Definition Covering A Variety Of Subjects Including Availability, Durability, Quality, And Sometimes The Function Of The Product. Reliability Engineering Was Developed To Quantify &ldquo;how Reliable&rdquo; A Component, Product, Or System Was When Used In A Specific Application For A Specific Period Of Time. The Data Center Industry Has Come To Rely On &ldquo;tier Classifications&rdquo; As Presented In A Number Of Papers By The Uptime Institute As A Gradient Scale Of Data Center Configurations And Requirements From Least (tier 1) To Most Reliable (tier 4). This Paper Will Apply The Principles And Modeling Techniques Of Reliability Engineering To Specific Examples Of Each Of The Tier Classifications And Discuss The Results.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Our society increasingly depends on computer-based systems; the number of applications deployed has increased dramatically in recent years and this trend is accelerating. Many of these applications are expected to provide their services continuously. The Service Availability Forum has recognized this need and developed a set of specifications to help software designers and developers to focus on the value added function of applications, leaving the availability management functions for the middleware. A practical and informative reference for the Service Availability Forum specifications, this book gives a cohesive explanation of the founding principles, motivation behind the design of the specifications, and the solutions, usage scenarios and limitations that a final system may have. Avoiding complex mathematical explanations, the book takes a pragmatic approach by discussing issues that are as close as possible to the daily software design/development by practitioners, and yet at a level that still takes in the overall picture. As a result, practitioners will be able to use the specifications as intended.  Takes a practical approach, giving guidance on the use of the specifications to explain the architecture, redundancy models and dependencies of the Service Availability (SA) Forum services Explains how service availability provides fault tolerance at the service level Clarifies how the SA Forum solution is supported by open source implementations of the middleware Includes fragments of code, simple example and use cases to give readers a practical understanding of the topic Provides a stepping stone for applications and system designers, developers and advanced students to help them understand and use the specifications</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Data Centers Form The Underpinnings Of The Global Technology Revolution That Is Cloud Computing. There Is Enormous Pressure For Data Center Growth And Expansion, To Meet The Computational Demands Of An Increasingly Digital World. With Energy Costs Overtaking Server Costs In Data Centers, Energy Is Fast Becoming A Significant Bottleneck To Data Center Scale-out. Further, The Global Data Center Energy Footprint Is Growing To Be A Significant Burden On The World&rsquo;s Energy Resources. Yet Energy Is A Signally Ill-managed Resource In Most Data Centers; Average Data Center Energy Efficiency Is Less Than 50%. With Increasing Industry Awareness Of The Magnitude And Urgency Of This Problem, Many Solutions Are Cropping Up To Combat Each Of The Several Sources Of Data Center Energy Inefficiency. The Objective Of This Dissertation Is Three-fold: First, We Examine The Causes Of Data Center Energy Inefficiency From First Principles, And Identify The Challenges Involved In Addressing Them. We Find Two Categories Of Energy Inefficiency: Idle Resource Energy Consumption, And Support Infrastructure Energy Consumption. Second, We Present Solutions To Address Each Form Of Inefficiency. We Describe Two Ways To Combat Idle Resource Energy Consumption, And Also Present A Systemic Solution To Tackle Both Forms Of Energy Inefficiency. Finally, Throughout This Dissertation, We Examine The Related Work And Literature, And Attempt To Map Them Into The Solution Space To Identify How The Solutions Relate With Each Other, And What Gaps Remain To Be Addressed. The Cloud Has The Potential To Enable Everything From Ubiquitous Computing And Universal Access To Knowledge, To Smart Power Grids, Greater Social Connectivity, And Near-infinite Extensibility Of Compute/storage Power. The Cloud Turns Computation Into A Utility, And By Doing So, Has The Potential To Make It Accessible To A Much Larger Part Of The World. This Dissertation Explores Ways To Enable Sustainable Scaling Of The Data Centers That Power The Cloud And Enable This Vision.</td>

Although The Use Of Sensors To Monitor Temperature, Smoke, Heat And Security Is Considered An Old Practice In Data Centers, The Full Utilization And Integration Of These Sensors Into Information Systems To Automate Data Centre Management Functions, Inform Decision Making In Data Centre Management And Transform Data Centers To Improve Their Operational, Economic And Environmental Performance Appears To Be Very Limited. The Paper Reviews The Current Literature And Concludes That There Is A Dearth For Empirical Studies That Focus On The Use Of Sbis And The Benefits Of Sbis To The Data Centers.

However, The Obligation Of Providing High Quality Of Service To Customers Leads To The Necessity In Dealing With The Energy-performance Trade-off, As Aggressive Consolidation May Lead To Performance Degradation. Because Of The Variability Of Workloads Experienced By Modern Applications, The Vm Placement Should Be Optimized Continuously In An Online Manner. To Understand The Implications Of The Online Nature Of The Problem, We Conduct A Competitive Analysis And Prove Competitive Ratios Of Optimal Online Deterministic Algorithms For The Single Vm Migration And Dynamic Vm Consolidation Problems. Furthermore, We Propose Novel Adaptive Heuristics For Dynamic Consolidation Of Vms Based On An Analysis Of Historical Data From The Resource Usage By Vms. The Proposed Algorithms Significantly Reduce Energy Consumption, While Ensuring A High Level Of Adherence To The Service Level Agreement. We Validate The High Efficiency Of The Proposed Algorithms By Extensive Simulations Using Real-world Workload Traces From More Than A Thousand Planetlab Vms.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cooling Is An Important Issue In Data Center Design And Operation. Accurate Evaluation Of A Design Or Operational Parameter Choice For Cooling Is Difficult As It Requires Several Runs Of Computationally Intensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (cfd) Based Models. Therefore There Is Need For An Exploration Method That Does Not Incur Enormous Computation. In Addition, The Exploration Should Also Provide Insights That Enable Informed Decision Making. Given These Twin Goals Of Reduced Computation And Improved Insights, We Present A Novel Approach To Data Center Cooling Exploration. The Key Idea Is To Do A Local Search Around The Current Design/operation Of A Data Center To Obtain Better Design/operation Parameters Subject To The Desired Constraints. To Do This, All The Microscopic Information About Airflow And Temperature In Data Center Available From A Single Run Of Cfd Computation Is Converted Into Macroscopic Metrics Called Influence Indices. The Influence Indices, Which Characterize The Causal Relationship Between Heat Sources And Sinks, Are Used To Refine The Design/operation Of The Data Center Either Manually Or Programmatically. New Designs Are Evaluated With Further Cfd Runs To Compute New Influence Indices And The Process Is Repeated To Yield Improved Designs As Per The Computation Budget Available. We Have Carried Out Design Exploration Of A Realistic Data Center Using This Methodology. Specifically, We Considered Maximization Of The Heat Load In The Data Center Subject To The Constraints That: 1) Servers Are Kept At Appropriate Temperatures And 2) Overloading Of Cracs Is Avoided. Our Evaluation Shows That The Use Of Influence Indices Cuts Down The Exploration Time By 80 % For A 1500 Sq. Ft. Data Center.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Over the last few years we have seen an increasing number of services and applications needed to manage and maintain cloud computing facilities. This is particularly true for computing in high energy physics, which often requires complex configurations and distributed infrastructures. In this scenario a cost effective rationalization and consolidation strategy is the key to success in terms of scalability and reliability. In this work we describe an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud computing system, with high availability and redundancy features, which is currently in production at INFN-Naples and ATLAS Tier-2 data centre. The main goal we intended to achieve was a simplified method to manage our computing resources and deliver reliable user services, reusing existing hardware without incurring heavy costs. A combined usage of virtualization and clustering technologies allowed us to consolidate our services on a small number of physical machines, reducing electric power costs. As a result of our efforts we developed a complete solution for data and computing centres that can be easily replicated using commodity hardware. Our architecture consists of 2 main subsystems: a clustered storage solution, built on top of disk servers running GlusterFS file system, and a virtual machines execution environment. GlusterFS is a network file system able to perform parallel writes on multiple disk servers, providing this way live replication of data. High availability is also achieved via a network configuration using redundant switches and multiple paths between hypervisor hosts and disk servers. We also developed a set of management scripts to easily perform basic system administration tasks such as automatic deployment of new virtual machines, adaptive scheduling of virtual machines on hypervisor hosts, live migration and automated restart in case of hypervisor failures.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtualization technologies enable the execution of multiple virtual machine instances (VMs) with different operating systems (OSs) on the same physical host. Each VM instance functions independently as an isolated system with its own physical resources, OS and applications. Due to significant cost saving and efficiency, the virtualization model has been increasingly adapted by enterprises and service providers as their main computing and service delivery infrastructure, running critical internal business and external customer facing applications. To minimize down time due to unexpected VM crashes, a high availability or backup system is usually built into the infrastructure. There are many high availability technology options available such as replication, mirroring and fail over clustering. Most of these solutions are usually designed based on the traditional computing model, they are costly to implement, complicated and tedious to maintain, especially in a virtualized environment, and they often require additional expensive hardware and software components. In this paper, we introduce a simple, flexible, scalable, extensible, efficient and cost effective system which utilizes the current VM infrastructure and common utilities to provide a high availability solution in the virtualization environment. Our smart adaptive snapshot replication technique provides a smooth and reliable mechanism for cost-performance, wherein the amount of resources allocated for high availability solution can be adjusted based on available resources, utilization and customer requirements.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, cloud computing has been emerging as the next big revolution in both computer networks and web provisioning. because of raised expectations, several vendors, such as amazon and ibm, started designing, developing, and deploying cloud solutions to optimize the usage of their own data centers, and some open-source solutions are also underway, such as eucalyptus and openstack. cloud architectures exploit virtualization techniques to provision multiple virtual machines (vms) on the same physical host, so as to efficiently use available resources, for instance, to consolidate vms in the minimal number of physical servers to reduce the runtime power consumption. vm consolidation has to carefully consider the aggregated resource consumption of co-located vms, in order to avoid performance reductions and service level agreement (sla) violations. while various works have already treated the vm consolidation problem from a theoretical perspective, this paper focuses on it from a more practical viewpoint, with specific attention on the consolidation aspects related to power, cpu, and networking resource sharing. moreover, the paper proposes a cloud management platform to optimize vm consolidation along three main dimensions, namely power consumption, host resources, and networking. reported experimental results point out that interferences between co-located vms have to be carefully considered to avoid placement solutions that, although being feasible from a more theoretical viewpoint, cannot ensure vm provisioning with sla guarantees.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Within datacenters, often multiple virtual machines (VMs) need to be live migrated simultaneously for various reasons such as maintenance, power savings, and load balancing. Such mass simultaneous live migration of multiple VMs can trigger large data transfers across the core network links and switches, and negatively affect the cluster-wide performance of network-bound applications. In this paper, we present a distributed system for inter-rack live migration (IRLM), i.e., parallel live migration of multiple VMs across racks. The key performance objective of IRLM is to reduce the traffic load on the core network links during mass VM migration through distributed deduplication of VMs' memory images. We present an initial prototype of IRLM that migrates multiple QEMU/KVM VMs within a Gigabit Ethernet cluster with 10GigE core links. We also present preliminary evaluation on a small testbed having 6 hosts per rack and 4 VMs per host. Our evaluations show that, compared to the default live migration technique in QEMU/KVM, IRLM reduces the network traffic on core links by up to 44&#37; and the total migration time by up to 26%. We also demonstrate that network-bound applications experience a smaller degradation during migration using IRLM.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtual machine (VM) replication has been recognized as an inexpensive way of providing high availability on commodity hardware. Unfortunately, its impact on system performance is far from negligible and strategies have been proposed to mitigate this problem. In this paper we take a look at VM replication from a different perspective: the choice of a hyper visor. Namely, the differences between hyper visors in terms of architecture and performance are well known and studied in the literature, but no analysis has been performed so far in the context of replication. Taking open-source hyper visors Xen and KVM as examples, we show what hyper visor services are necessary to implement a primary-backup replication scheme and how hyper visor design affects the development steps and the performance. Interestingly, our user space implementation on top of KVM achieves roughly the same performance as an already existing, more mature Xen implementation, which leads us to the conclusion that the inherent cost of the replication scheme dominates the differences between the chosen hyper visors.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtualized Datacenters And Clouds Are Being Increasingly Considered For Traditional High-performance Computing (hpc) Workloads That Have Typically Targeted Grids And Conventional Hpc Platforms. However, Maximizing Energy Efficiency And Utilization Of Datacenter Resources, And Minimizing Undesired Thermal Behavior While Ensuring Application Performance And Other Quality Of Service (qos) Guarantees For Hpc Applications Requires Careful Consideration Of Important And Extremely Challenging Tradeoffs. Virtual Machine (vm) Migration Is One Of The Most Common Techniques Used To Alleviate Thermal Anomalies (i.e., Hotspots) In Cloud Datacenter Servers As It Reduces Load And, Hence, The Server Utilization. In This Article, The Benefits Of Using Other Techniques Such As Voltage Scaling And Pinning (traditionally Used For Reducing Energy Consumption) For Thermal Management Over Vm Migrations Are Studied In Detail. As No Single Technique Is The Most Efficient To Meet Temperature/performance Optimization Goals In All Situations, An Autonomic Approach That Performs Energy-efficient Thermal Management While Ensuring The Qos Delivered To The Users Is Proposed. To Address The Problem Of Vm Allocation That Arises During Vm Migrations, An Innovative Application-centric Energy-aware Strategy For Virtual Machine (vm) Allocation Is Proposed. The Proposed Strategy Ensures High Resource Utilization And Energy Efficiency Through Vm Consolidation While Satisfying Application Qos By Exploiting Knowledge Obtained Through Application Profiling Along Multiple Dimensions (cpu, Memory, And Network Bandwidth Utilization). To Support Our Arguments, We Present The Results Obtained From An Experimental Evaluation On Real Hardware Using Hpc Workloads Under Different Scenarios.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: A Data Center Is A Facility Used To Keep Computer Related Equipments. It Is Estimated That Heat Production Rate Of The Data Center Is Doubled In Every Two Years And Hence The Inevitability Of The Cooling System Gets Increased. In Due Course Power Consumption Of A Data Center Is Augmented And More Cost Is Spent On The Power Usage Of The Cooling System Rather Than The Equipment Purchase. As A Result Power Savings For The Cooling System Is Strongly Desired. In This Paper We Conferred Two Primary Free Cooling Systems Namely Air Economizer And Water Economizer. A Free Cooling Economizer System Uses The Outside Air Which Is Forced To The Data Center When Outside Climate Is Suitable To Meet The Ashre's Cooling Requirements. We Have Also Conducted A Survey And Simulation Based Estimation Using Trace[tm] Chiller Plant Analyzer Tool. In This Study, The Energy Consumption In A Data Center Using Conventional Cooling System Is Compared With Air Economizer And Water Economizer For Three Different Zones Namely Chicago, Atlanta And Phoenix In View Of The Fact That The Outside Air Is Relatively Cool Most Of The Year. From The Projected Result It Is Observed That Both Economizers Reduce Energy And Cost When Compared With Conventional System And The Usage Of Economizer Permits The Chiller To Shut Down Or Reduce Chiller Energy Load Under Suitable Weather Conditions. The Results Show That Water Economizers Are Shown To Consistently Outperform Air Economizer Which Provides Significant Improvement In Cooling System Efficiency And Cost At Data Center. The Performance Ratio Of The Conventional, Air Economizer And The Water Economizers Are 50 76% And 79% Respectively That Shows Economizers Provide More Savings Relative To The Conventional System.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Data Centers' Energy Consumption Has Attracted Global Attention Because Of The Fast Growth Of The Information Technology (it) Industry. Up To 60% Of The Energy Consumed In A Data Center Is Used For Cooling In Wasteful Ways As A Result Of Lack Of Environmental Information And Overcompensated Cooling Systems. In This Project, A Wireless Sensor Network For Data-enter Environmental Monitoring Was Developed To Improve Energy Efficiency And To Optimize Data-center Performance. The Sensor Network Consists Of A Suite Of Sensor Nodes For Data Sensing, A Router Node To Relay Sensed Data, And A Coordinator Node To Establish A Network, Receive The Data, And Process The Data. The Prototype Sensor Network Was Built On Arduino Open Source Hardware With A Seamlessly Integrated Xbee Rf Module And Configured To Operate Within The Zigbee Mesh Network Standard. A 24-hour Test Run At Argonne's Data Center Demonstrated That The Wireless Networked Environmental Monitoring Solution Is Easy To Integrate And Manage With The Existing It Infrastructure, While Delivering Better Visibility Into The Data Center's 3d Temperature And Humidity Distribution And Substantial Improvements In Energy Efficiency.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtualization is a common strategy to improve the existing computing resources, particularly in cloud computing field. Hadoop, one of Apache projects, is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, and each offer local computation and storage. However, how to guarantee stability and reliability have become great study topics. In this article, we use current open-source based on software and platform to reach our goal. For instance, Xen-Hyper visor virtualization technology, Open Nebula virtual machines management tool, and so on. After extending component capabilities, we developed a mechanism to support our idea and reached Hadoop High Availability which called Virtualization Fault Tolerance (VFT). We consider a practical problem that occurs frequently in our system, and the results in this paper also confirm the downtime time can be shortened if failure occurred. In this case, it is not only for the Hadoop applications, but also extended to more areas of cluster-based systems.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Virtualization has become a key technology for simplifying service management and reducing energy costs in data centers. One of the challenges faced by data centers is to decide when, how, and which virtual machines (VMs) have to be consolidated into a single physical server. Server consolidation involves VM migration, which has a direct impact on service response time. Most of the existing solutions for server consolidation rely on eager migrations, which try to minimize the number of physical servers running VMs. These solutions generate unnecessary migrations due to unpredictable workloads that require VM resizing. This paper proposes an LP formulation and heuristics to control VM migration, which prioritize virtual machines with steady capacity. We performed experiments using TU-Berlin and Google data center workloads to compare our migration control strategy against existing eager-migration-based solutions. We observed that avoiding migration of VMs with steady capacity reduces the number of migrations with minimal penalty in the number of physical servers.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The placement of virtual machines (VMs) on a cluster of hosts under multiple constraints, including administrative (security, regulations) resource-oriented (capacity, energy), and QoS-oriented (performance) is a highly complex task. We define a new high-availability property for a VM; when a VM is marked as k-resilient, as long as there are up to k host failures, it should be guaranteed that it can be relocated to a non-failed host without relocating other VMs. Together with Hardware Predictive Failure Analysis and live migration, which enable VMs to be evacuated from a host before it fails, this property allows the continuous running of YMs on the cluster despite host failures. The complexity of the constraints associated with k-resiliency, which are naturally expressed by Second Order logic statements, prevented their integration into the placement computation until now. We present a novel algorithm which enables this integration by transforming the k-resiliency constraints to rules consumable by a generic Constraint Programming engine, prove that it guarantees the required resiliency and describe the implementation. We provide some preliminary results and compare our high availability support with naive solutions.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: We address the challenge of providing unified cloud resource management towards an overall business level objective, given the multitude of managerial tasks to be performed and the complexity of any architecture to support them. Resource level management tasks include elasticity control, virtual machine and data placement, autonomous fault management, etc, which are intrinsically difficult problems since services normally have unknown lifetime and capacity demands that varies largely over time. To unify the management of these problems, (for optimization with respect to some higher level business level objective, like optimizing revenue while breaking no more than a certain percentage of service level agreements)becomes even more challenging as the resource level managerial challenges are far from independent. After providing the general problem formulation, we review recent approaches taken by the research community, including mainly general autonomic computing technology for large-scale environments and resource level management tools equipped with some business oriented or otherwise qualitative features. We propose and illustrate a policy-driven approach where a high-level management system monitors overall system and services behavior and adjusts lower level policies (e.g., thresholds for admission control, elasticity control, server consolidation level, etc) for optimization towards the measurable business level objectives.</td>

In particular, the capability of virtual machine(VM) migration brings multiple benefits for such as resources(CPU, memory, et al.) distribution, energy aware consolidation. However, the migration of virtual machines itself brings extra power consumption. For this reason, a better understanding of its effect on system power consumption is highly desirable. In this paper, we present a power consumption evaluation on the effects of live migration of VMs. Results show that the power overhead of migration is much less in the scenario of employing the strategy of consolidation than the regular deployment without using consolidation. Our results are based on the typical physical server, the power of which is linear model of CPU utilization percentage.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The primary purpose of this book is to capture the state-of-the-art in Cloud Computing technologies and applications. The book will also aim to identify potential research directions and technologies that will facilitate creation a global market-place of cloud computing services supporting scientific, industrial, business, and consumer applications. We expect the book to serve as a reference for larger audience such as systems architects, practitioners, developers, new researchers and graduate level students. This area of research is relatively recent, and as such has no existing reference book that addresses it. This book will be a timely contribution to a field that is gaining considerable research interest, momentum, and is expected to be of increasing interest to commercial developers. The book is targeted for professional computer science developers and graduate students especially at Masters level. As Cloud Computing is recognized as one of the top five emerging technologies that will have a major impact on the quality of science and society over the next 20 years, its knowledge will help position our readers at the forefront of the field.</td>

The common characteristics most interpretations share are on-demand scalability of highly available and reliable pooled computing resources, secure access to metered services from nearly anywhere, and displacement of data and services from inside to outside the organization. While aspects of these characteristics have been realized to a certain extent, cloud computing remains a work in progress. This publication provides an overview of the security and privacy challenges pertinent to public cloud computing and points out considerations organizations should take when outsourcing data, applications, and infrastructure to a public cloud environment.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The evolution of cloud computing over the past few years is potentially one of the major advances in the history of computing. However, if cloud computing is to achieve its potential, there needs to be a clear understanding of the various issues involved, both from the perspectives of the providers and the consumers of the technology. While a lot of research is currently taking place in the technology itself, there is an equally urgent need for understanding the business-related issues surrounding cloud computing. In this article, we identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the cloud computing industry. We then identify the various issues that will affect the different stakeholders of cloud computing. We also issue a set of recommendations for the practitioners who will provide and manage this technology. For IS researchers, we outline the different areas of research that need attention so that we are in a position to advice the industry in the years to come. Finally, we outline some of the key issues facing governmental agencies who, due to the unique nature of the technology, will have to become intimately involved in the regulation of cloud computing.</td>

This Paper Presents A Bottom-up Model That Can Be Used To Estimate Total Data Center Electricity Demand Within A Region As Well As The Potential Electricity Savings Associated With Energy Efficiency Improvements. The Model Is Applied To Estimate 2008 U.s. Data Center Electricity Demand And The Technical Potential For Electricity Savings Associated With Major Measures For It Devices And Infrastructure Equipment. Results Suggest That 2008 Demand Was Approximately 69 Billion Kilowatt Hours (1.8% Of 2008 Total U.s. Electricity Sales) And That It May Be Technically Feasible To Reduce This Demand By Up To 80% (to 13 Billion Kilowatt Hours) Through Aggressive Pursuit Of Energy Efficiency Measures. Measure-level Savings Estimates Are Provided, Which Shed Light On The Relative Importance Of Different Measures At The National Level. Measures Applied To Servers Are Found To Have The Greatest Contribution To Potential Savings.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Multi-cluster is the common underlying architecture of most grid and cloud environments, which usually consist of multiple clusters located at different places. One important characteristic of such computing environments is the performance difference between intra-cluster and inter-cluster communications. Intra-cluster communication networks usually have shorter latency and larger bandwidth than inter-cluster networks. Therefore, in those systems parallel jobs are intended to be executed within a single one of the clusters to achieve better performance although co-allocation across multiple clusters is sometimes technically possible. Under such job execution policy resource fragmentation becomes a crucial issue that happens when there is no single cluster being able to accommodate a job while the total number of processors in the entire grid or cloud is enough for the job. This paper proposes a most-fit policy to reduce resource fragmentation occurrences and evaluates it with several existing processor allocation policies. The experimental results indicate that careful selection of processor allocation policies can improve overall system performance greatly and the proposed most-fit policy can outperform other policies in most conditions.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This Paper Presents An Immune-inspired Technique For Optimizing A Server Energy Consumption. The Proposed Technique Is Similar With An Artificial Immune System Associated To A Server, Aiming To Detect Non-optimal Server Energy Consumption States And To Take The Appropriate Actions That Would Bring The Server Into An Optimal State. The Optimization Technique Has Two Main Stages: An Initialization Stage And A Self-optimization Stage. In The Initialization Stage The Server Is Monitored For A Specific Period Of Time To Collect Energy Consumption Historical Raw Data For Identifying Associations Between The Server Energy Consumption States And The Appropriate Optimization Actions. In The Self-optimization Stage, Energy Consumption Server State Snapshots Are Taken At Regular Time Intervals And Formally Represented Using A Biologically-inspired Antigen Model. The Obtained Antigen Is Then Classified As Self (optimal Energy Consumption State) Or Non-self (non-optimal Energy Consumption State) Using A Set Of Detectors Obtained In The Initialization Stage. For Non-self Antigens A Biologically-inspired Clonal Selection Approach Is Used To Determine The Actions That Need To Be Taken To Bring The Server In An Optimal Energy Consumption State.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Information Technology Data Centers Consume A Large Amount Of Electricity In The Us And World-wide. Cooling Has Been Found To Contribute About One Third Of This Energy Use. The Two Primary Contributors To The Data Center Cooling Energy Use Are The Refrigeration Chiller And The Computer Room Air Conditioning Units (cracs). There Have Been Recent Changes In Specifications For The Data Center Environmental Envelopes As Mandated By Ashrae (american Society For Heating Refrigeration And Air Conditioning Engineers), One Of Which Specifically Pertains To The Upper And Lower Bound Of Air Temperatures At The Inlet To Servers That Are Housed In Data Center Rooms. These Changes Have Been Put In Place In Part To Address The Desire For Greater Cooling Energy Efficiency Of These Facilities. This Paper Primarily Focuses On The Methodologies To Reduce The Energy Usage Of Room Air Conditioning Devices By Exploiting These Recent Changes In Standards For The Equipment Environmental Envelope. A 22000 Square Foot (6706 M2) Data Center With 739 Kilo Watt Of It Load Is Used As A Representative Example For Numerical Cfd Analyses Using A Commercial Software Package To Demonstrate Methodologies To Reduce The Cooling Energy Use Of Information Technology Data Centers. Several Test Case Simulations Are Used To Enable The Calculation Of Room Level Air Temperature Fields For Varying Design Conditions Such As Different Numbers Of Operational Cracs Or The Volumetric Air Flow Rate Setting Of The Cracs. Computation Of Cooling Energy Is Carried Out Using Available Vendor Equipment Information. The Relationship Between The Reduction In Energy Usage In Crac Units And The Server Inlet Air Temperatures Are Quantified And A Systematic Methodology For Crac Shut Off Is Proposed. The Relative Magnitude Of Reduction In Data Center Cooling Energy Use From Shutting Off Cracs Or Reducing Crac Motor Speeds Is Also Compared With Scenarios Involving Increases In Refrigeration Chiller Plant Water Temperatu- - Re Set Point.</td>

Reliability Engineering Was Developed To Quantify &ldquo;how Reliable&rdquo; A Component, Product Or System Was When Used In A Specific Application For A Specific Period Of Time. The Data Center Industry Has Come To Rely On &ldquo;tier Classifications&rdquo; As Presented In A Number Of Papers By The Uptime Institute [1] As A Gradient Scale Of Data Center Configurations And Requirements From Least (tier 1) To Most Reliable (tier 4). This Paper Will Apply The Principles And Modeling Techniques Of Reliability Engineering To Specific Examples That Were Selected Based On Gradient Scale Provided By The Tier Classifications And Discuss The Results.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Consolidated server systems using server virtualization involves serious risks of host server failures that induce unexpected downs of all hosted virtual machines and applications. To protect applications requiring high-availability from unpredictable host server failures, redundant configuration using virtual machines can be an effective countermeasure. This paper presents a virtual machine placement method for establishing a redundant configuration against host server failures with less host servers. The proposed method estimates the requisite minimum number of virtual machines according to the performance requirements of application services and decides an optimum virtual machine placement so that minimum configurations survive at any k host server failures. The evaluation results clarify that the proposed method achieves requested fault-tolerance level with less number of hosting servers compared to the conventional N+M redundant configuration approach.</td>

From Either Perspective, ''cloud'' Is Now The Label Of Choice For Accountable Pay-per-use Access To Third Party Applications And Computational Resources On A Massive Scale. Clouds Support Patterns Of Less Predictable Resource Use For Applications And Services Across The It Spectrum, From Online Office Applications To High-throughput Transactional Services And High-performance Computations Involving Substantial Quantities Of Processing Cycles And Storage. The Concept Of Clouds Seems To Blur The Distinctions Between A Variety Of Technologies That Encompass Grid Services, Web Services And Data Centres, And Leads To Considerations Of Lowered-cost Provisioning For Bursty Applications.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Through the recent emergence of joint resource and network virtualization, dynamic composition and provisioning of time-limited and isolated virtual infrastructures is now possible. One other benefit of infrastructure virtualization is the capability of transparent reliability provisioning (reliability becomes a service provided by the infrastructure). In this context, we discuss the motivations and gains of introducing customizable reliability of virtual infrastructures when executing large-scale distributed applications, and present a framework to specify, allocate and deploy virtualized infrastructure with reliability capabilities. An approach to efficiently specify and control the reliability at runtime is proposed. We illustrate these ideas by analyzing the introduction of reliability at the virtual-infrastructure level on a real application. Experimental results, obtained with an actual medical-imaging application running in virtual infrastructures provisioned in the experimental large-scale Grid'5000 platform, show the benefits of the virtualization of reliability.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The Energy Consumption Of Under-utilized Resources, Particularly In A Cloud Environment, Accounts For A Substantial Amount Of The Actual Energy Use. Inherently, A Resource Allocation Strategy That Takes Into Account Resource Utilization Would Lead To A Better Energy Efficiency; This, In Clouds, Extends Further With Virtualization Technologies In That Tasks Can Be Easily Consolidated. Task Consolidation Is An Effective Method To Increase Resource Utilization And In Turn Reduces Energy Consumption. Recent Studies Identified That Server Energy Consumption Scales Linearly With (processor) Resource Utilization. This Encouraging Fact Further Highlights The Significant Contribution Of Task Consolidation To The Reduction In Energy Consumption. However, Task Consolidation Can Also Lead To The Freeing Up Of Resources That Can Sit Idling Yet Still Drawing Power. There Have Been Some Notable Efforts To Reduce Idle Power Draw, Typically By Putting Computer Resources Into Some Form Of Sleep/power-saving Mode. In This Paper, We Present Two Energy-conscious Task Consolidation Heuristics, Which Aim To Maximize Resource Utilization And Explicitly Take Into Account Both Active And Idle Energy Consumption. Our Heuristics Assign Each Task To The Resource On Which The Energy Consumption For Executing The Task Is Explicitly Or Implicitly Minimized Without The Performance Degradation Of That Task. Based On Our Experimental Results, Our Heuristics Demonstrate Their Promising Energy-saving Capability.</td>

Handbook of Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety in Engineering Design not only encompasses a depth of research into engineering design methods and techniques ranging from quantitative probability theory and expert judgement in Bayesian analysis to qualitative possibility theory, fuzzy logic and uncertainty in Markov analysis; from reliability block diagrams, fault trees, event trees and cause-consequence diagrams to Petri nets, genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks; but it also covers a breadth of research into the concept of integrity in engineering design. Such breadth of research is represented by the inclusion of the topics of reliability and performance, availability and maintainability, and safety and risk, in an overall concept of designing for integrity during the different phases of the engineering design process. These topics add significant value to the theoretical expertise and practical experience of process, chemical, civil, mechanical, electrical, and electronic engineers, by considering process engineering design from the point of view of ''what should be achieved'' to meet criteria for designing for reliability, availability, maintainability and safety.</td>

The Design Of A Wsn Depends Significantly On The Application, And It Must Consider Factors Such As The Environment, The Application's Design Objectives, Cost, Hardware, And System Constraints. The Goal Of Our Survey Is To Present A Comprehensive Review Of The Recent Literature Since The Publication Of [i.f. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Today's data centers may contain tens of thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50&#37; of the aggregate bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring tremendous cost. Non-uniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates application design and limits overall system performance. In this paper, we show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements. Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and interconnected commodity switches may deliver more performance at less cost than available from today's higher-end solutions. Our approach requires no modifications to the end host network interface, operating system, or applications; critically, it is fully backward compatible with Ethernet, IP, and TCP.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: High-performance Computing Data Centers Have Been Rapidly Growing, Both In Number And Size. Thermal Management Of Data Centers Can Address Dominant Problems Associated With Cooling Such As The Recirculation Of Hot Air From The Equipment Outlets To Their Inlets And The Appearance Of Hot Spots. In This Paper, We Show Through Formalization That Minimizing The Peak Inlet Temperature Allows For The Lowest Cooling Power Needs. Using A Low-complexity Linear Heat Recirculation Model, We Define The Problem Of Minimizing The Peak Inlet Temperature Within A Data Center Through Task Assignment (mpit-ta), Consequently Leading To Minimal Cooling-requirement. We Also Provide Two Methods To Solve The Formulation: Xlnt-ga, Which Uses A Genetic Algorithm, And Xlnt-sqp, Which Uses Sequential Quadratic Programming. Results From Small-scale Data Center Simulations Show That Solving The Formulation Leads To An Inlet Temperature Distribution That, Compared To Other Approaches, Is 2 Degc To 5 Degc Lower And Achieves About 20 To 30 Percent Cooling Energy Savings At Common Data Center Utilization Rates. Moreover, Our Algorithms Consistently Outperform The Minimize Heat Recirculation Algorithm, A Recirculation-reducing Task Placement Algorithm In The Literature.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Power management has become increasingly necessary in large-scale datacenters to address costs and limitations in cooling or power delivery. This paper explores how to integrate power management mechanisms and policies with the virtualization technologies being actively deployed in these environments. The goals of the proposed VirtualPower approach to online power management are (i) to support the isolated and independent operation assumed by guest virtual machines (VMs) running on virtualized platforms and (ii) to make it possible to control and globally coordinate the effects of the diverse power management policies applied by these VMs to virtualized resources. To attain these goals, VirtualPower extends to guest VMs `soft' versions of the hardware power states for which their policies are designed. The resulting technical challenge is to appropriately map VM-level updates made to soft power states to actual changes in the states or in the allocation of underlying virtualized hardware. An implementation of VirtualPower Management (VPM) for the Xen hypervisor addresses this challenge by provision of multiple system-level abstractions including VPM states, channels, mechanisms, and rules. Experimental evaluations on modern multicore platforms highlight resulting improvements in online power management capabilities, including minimization of power consumption with little or no performance penalties and the ability to throttle power consumption while still meeting application requirements. Finally, coordination of online methods for server consolidation with VPM management techniques in heterogeneous server systems is shown to provide up to 34&#37; improvements in power consumption.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Modern society depends heavily upon a host of systems of varying complexity to perform the services required. The importance of reliability assumes new dimensions, primarily because of the higher cost of these highly complex machines required by mankind and the implication of their failure. This is why all industrial organizations wish to equip their scientists, engineers, managers and administrators with a knowledge of reliability concepts and applications. Based on the author's 20 years experience as reliability educator, researcher and consultant, Reliability Engineering introduces the reader systematically to reliability evaluation, prediction, allocation and optimization.  It also covers further topics, such as maintainability and availability, software reliability, economics of reliability, reliability management, reliability testing, etc. A reliability study of some typical systems has been included to introduce the reader to the practical aspects.  The book is intended for graduate students of engineering schools and also professional engineers, managers and reliability administrators as it has a wide coverage of reliability concepts.</td>

The course has been taught jointly by David F. Haasl, Institute of System Sciences, Professor Norman H. Roberts, University of Washington, and members of the Probabilistic Analysis Staff, NRC, as part of a risk assessment training program sponsored by the Probabilistic Analysis Staff. This handbook has been developed not only to serve as text for the System Safety and Reliability Course, but also to make available to others a set of otherwise undocumented material on fault tree construction and evaluation. The publication of this handbook is in accordance with the recommendations of the Risk Assessment Review Group Report (NUREG/CR-0400) in which it was stated that the fault/event tree methodology both can and should be used more widely by the NRC. It is hoped that this document will help to codify and systematize the fault tree approach to systems analysis.</td>
